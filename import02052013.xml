    <title><![CDATA[Can Fast Fashion get any faster?  ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>What we call Fast Fashion is essentially a method to respond quickly to consumer trends and demands through enhanced production and design capabilities with the objective to produce what&rsquo;s hot in the market at the right time.&nbsp; But while short lead times in production and distribution are a pre-requisite of fast fashion, another key component to shortening the overall cycle is accelerating the consumer&rsquo;s purchase decision. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These past few years, technology has played an essential role in influencing consumer behavior. We see many fashion brands and retailers looking at innovative technology to offer their customers new ways of shopping and accelerating their buying decision. It&rsquo;s not just about giving consumers the means to buy faster but also to buy better and smarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;A recent example is New Look&rsquo;s Stratford store trying out the world&rsquo;s first 3D body scanner.&nbsp; It uses a myriad of 3D sensors that map the body and take exact measurements to advise the shopper on the best fitting products &ndash;jeans, in this case.&nbsp; The consumer then knows exactly which products in the store have the right fit for her.&nbsp; Digitalization of the body is the next step in our already highly digitalized world and, combined with online shopping, retailers could be very close to providing the ultimate shopping experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about EspaceMax, a leading French luxury goods and fashion e-shopping store.&nbsp; They used a 3D interactive solution to enable customers to manipulate handbags, placing objects of daily life inside to simulate product behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s not all.&nbsp; The shopper can &ldquo;try it on&rdquo; by using a virtual animated model that walks and handles the bag like anyone would.&nbsp;&nbsp; Combine these two experiences together and replace the animated model with your own digitalized body and online shopping is going to get as real as it can get!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology can change the game of shopping for everyone:&nbsp; customers will have the ability and the satisfaction to get the right product right away and retailers could see a significant reduction in product returns which would have a direct positive impact on their operating costs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;So can fast fashion get any faster? Yes, it can!</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<p><strong>Fashion designers must know how to sketch the latest design on a pad of paper but they also need to know about leading edge technology too.</strong></p>
<p>I recently browsed the course program of the University of the Arts of London Saint Martin&rsquo;s College and I was surprised to see the number of courses that started with the words 3D and Digital (e.g., Digital Fashion, Digital Print, 3D Fashion Design, etc.). It may be a generation gap (I wasn&rsquo;t born with Internet now you know ) or it may not. Christopher Bailey (who&rsquo;s older than me!) may not have studied at St Martins, nor is he part of the Internet generation, but certainly his embrace of the web has largely contributed to the success of Burberry in the past few years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As luxury brands look at new ways to gain new markets, they look into reaching broader audiences. Expanding geographically in the BRIC countries is one very lucrative way but brands also need to expand across the different layers of the population in their own traditional markets. The web is just the right tool in helping in the democratization of the &euro;500 handbag!</p>
<p>Some would argue that the very principle of luxury is that it cannot be accessible by all and that explains why some brands have been so slow &ndash; reluctant? &ndash; on the uptake of technology. Today&rsquo;s emerging ready-to-wear brands need to embrace technology, new media, as well as social media to get minimum grounding in the industry and to even start thinking of their future. They need to fully understand the new social interactions and need not be afraid of experimenting with new go-to-market experiences. Shutting the door to new technology can often result in shutting the door to their brand.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Virtually Trying Bags]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>I am not the kind of person who will buy a bag on-line. When I shop on-line, I generally buy services. For example I buy my on-line flight tickets, I book my hotel, I order my kitchen trash&hellip; but for apparel, shoes, bags, it is a different story.<br />The reason is simple: when I buy a bag for example, I want to touch it, I want to check its size, and see how it fits on me. Checking those elements on-line is not that easy with only one picture.<br />But if I hear about a new way of looking at the bag, the story is completely different.<br />EspaceMax is a French luxury goods and fashion e-shopping store. They have been using 3D and virtual technologies to bring their handbags to &ldquo;life&rdquo;on-line.<br />&nbsp;Indeed with what I saw there, I can now virtually interact with the handbag before purchasing it on-line, as I would interact with it in real life.</p>
<p>I can virtually open the bag, look how many pockets are available, if it has a zip or not, if it has a space to put my mobile phone in. I can also put usual (virtual) objects in it: for example I can see if a bottle of water fits in it. And the best: I can see the bag&rsquo;s look and feel on a virtual mannequin as if it was me!</p>
<p><br />Check it yourself and watch the video!</p>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[Chaos + Silence = Innovation ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>Sixty years ago, the composer and innovator John Cage entered an anechoic chamber at Harvard University, searching for the meaning of Silence. He sat there, cut off from all the buzz of the world, and after a time, began to hear a low, regular rhythm. <br /><br />We are all exposed to a constant barrage of emotion and information, from nearby or distant sources, on topics we love or don&rsquo;t care much about. We see, listen and read; we live revelations and moments of darkness. Every new subject is like a bird lifting off - by the end of the day, we have a huge number of birds flying around in our head in a vibrant and chaotic inner landscape. It's very, very noisy in there. <br /><br />Great innovators let the birds come down, settle, and cover the fields and the trees. Some might travel to India, practice meditation, or learn to build things with their hands. Others like Cage will go to extremes to find a place away from everything. <br /><br />They will have shut off the noise, and gone down very deep, so that they can connect with what created the noise in the first place, and was later covered by it. Sometimes this connection happens slowly over time, sometimes in a split second. Then comes the innovation moment of truth, when chaos and its absence come together and a new idea is born. <br /><br />Fashion Lab was created to be to innovation in its own field what the anechoic chamber was for Cage. It is designed as a place where new ideas can emerge from chaos because a lot of noise is suppressed, letting imagination and creativity soar. But be warned that such a place is not totally silent.&nbsp; Like John Cage at Harvard, you will be deafened by the beating of your own heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&laquo;&nbsp;David Bonner, Jean-Jacques Auffret, Dassault Systems Research&nbsp;&raquo;<br /><br /></p>]]></body>

    <body><![CDATA[<p>On Nov. 23rd, Dassault Syst&egrave;mes launched Natural Sketch (NTS), a new product that helps 3D sketching experience.</p>
<p>But you are asking yourself: what is a 3D sketching Experience?<br />This is almost like drawing on a paper, but digitally.

Of course, you must know how to draw <br />And what&rsquo;s really great afterwards is that you can put it into 3D!<br />Look at the video to see Julien Fourni&eacute; using it to design a dress!</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Advertising campaigns doing just more than promotion]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>Some apparel companies do not hesitate to use chocking communication campaigns.<br />Very often it is around sexy images, because we all know that a sexy image sells well! <br />See for example the campaign from the famous brand American Apparel launched not so long ago: <a href="http://www.designscene.net/2011/11/american-apparel-campaign.html">http://www.designscene.net/2011/11/american-apparel-campaign.html</a> <br />Personally when I look at such ads, I am not looking at the shoe itself but more the image it is revealing. <br />However sometimes it is not necessarily sexy, or reflecting any specific brand image, but it aimed to spread a message&hellip; <br />United Colors of Benetton get back to it's roots in it's new ad campaign. Called the <em>&ldquo;UNHATE&rdquo; campaign</em>, it is looking at fighting against the &ldquo;culture of hatred&rdquo;. And the example here is clearly explicit!<br />So, does it work?<br />Are you wearing a Benetton shirt because you are an angel willing to erase hatred? <br />Or are you just looking forward to the new collection because you like Benetton&rsquo;s garments?</p>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[EVOLUTION: Jonathan Riss takes the art of embroidery to new heights]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>It began as a personal project, something to pursue as a hobby. Jonathan Riss, creative director of the brand Jay Ahr, was fascinated by &ldquo;Evolution&rdquo;, a series of photographs by Patrick Gries depicting Paris' Natural History Museum's collections of vertebrates. He rang the photographer up and told him he wanted somehow to collaborate, but he didn&rsquo;t yet know how. <br /><br />Cut to a tiny rural village in China called Xi Qian, which Jonathan discovered thanks to an official in Beijing several years ago. Here, the men till the land and the women embroider. &ldquo;There are families of four generations where all the women embroider. Each one has a specialty in a different kind of embroidery. Some are great at thread embroidery, others are great at working with pearls" explains Jonathan. He began working with this group of women on various projects for his fashion label, but eventually developed the desire to work on an embroidery project unrelated to fashion. <br /><br />This is when it dawned on him that he could merge the work of Patrick Gries with his own work in embroidery, and thereby join two opposites: time versus timelessness. On the one hand, there is the concept of evolution. Living species have evolved from the primordial soup into creatures like the majestuous cheetah.</p>]]></body>

    <body><![CDATA[<p><strong>The reason why, as a fashion designer, I chose Couture, probably lies in the tradition of Paris, my hometown&hellip; but also in the future I bet this field of excellence will develop. Haute Couture has been, since its beginnings, the best laboratory for fashion design. It will continue if it includes the future technological improvements offered now and tomorrow.</strong></p>
<p>Every woman is unique and every fashion designer knows it.<strong> </strong>Couture and Haute Couture were established and have developped in France since the 19th century, creating unique designs for unique moments in a unique woman&rsquo;s life. This expression of ultimate luxury does not only find its legitimacy in the imagination of great fashion designers and couturiers such as Charles Frederick Worth, Jeanne Lanvin, Madeleine Vionnet, Elsa Schiaparelli, Poiret, Chanel, Christian Dior, Jacques Fath, Hubert de Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Paco Rabanne, Claude Montana, Thierry Mugler, Jean Paul Gaultier, and the few contemporary members of the official calendar of Haute Couture. Its unrivaled excellence is also the fruit of the seamstresses' ateliers, of the embroiderers', pleaters', featherers' exceptional craftsmanship. All of our common efforts express themselves at best in this made-to-measure craft, in which we can experiment without limits in order to create a collection or an outfit made to embody a dream.</p>
<p>Earlier, in the 1950s, during the Golden Age of Haute Couture, a doctor&rsquo;s wife for instance could afford building her wardroble (including daywear) in the price range of Haute Couture pieces. Nowadays, things have changed. Working forces have been gradually better paid and the cost of the splendid outfits has increased tremendously, due to the number of working hours spent on them. Luxury ready-to-wear has replaced Haute Couture in the physician&rsquo;s wife wardrobe, and only a few women around the planet, can still afford these one-of-a-kind fashion pieces. Still, Haute Couture remains the fine window in which fashion design is experimented at best, with less limits than when a designer considers to embrace only ready-to-wear collections.</p>
<p>I believe in the future of Haute Couture because fashion cannot lose its laboratory to experiment and create new designs outside the limits of &laquo;&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;&raquo; pieces. For the sake of Haute Couture, I believe that we need to renovate it with the new technologies we have access to today. My partnership with Dassault Syst&egrave;mes' Fashion Lab finds all its meaning in this field. Of course, the young couture house I have founded in Paris will continue to serve its customers. Of course we shall also develop ready-to-wear lines in the near future, but I would not be surprised if the technology we are currently working on with Dassault Syst&egrave;mes inside the FashionLab, would revolutionize the way we think about fashion design.</p>
<p>Imagine a world in which a woman would no longer be considered a &laquo;&nbsp;size 0&nbsp;&raquo;, or a &laquo;&nbsp;size 2&nbsp;&raquo;, or any other standardized size, but looked upon by a fashion house as a person having different measurements (waistline, chest, legs length, shoulders, neck etc.) This could precisely embody the future of fashion: producing some made-to-measure garments, and making them accessible at a reasonable price via the new digital technologies.</p>
<p>The passion I am sharing with the few women who can afford Haute Couture when I create an outfit for one of them, I would like to share with many more, and customize, personalize each dress a woman buys at any price. Ready-to-wear pieces are produced in an industrial manner, maybe tomorow, thanks to&nbsp; the new technologies we are thinking about, they can integrate more craftsmanship, more personnalization,&nbsp; take into account more individual data, so that they can still be thought out withinh the industrial process but as one-of-a-kind pieces directed at more women. This is my dream and I know that Dasault Syst&egrave;mes' FashionLab teams are already trying their best to&nbsp; soon make it come true!</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<p>The first New York fashion Week location was Bryant Park, and then Lincoln Center. But it the has grown so much it&rsquo;s already extend beyond Lincoln Center. Now, rumor has it the New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, <em>wants</em> to move the NYC Fashion Week on Manhattan's Far West Side, along 10th avenue and 33rd street, in a $15 billion development project&nbsp;including among other things, commercial, cultural and entertainment space.</p>
<p>Having all week&rsquo;s events spent in the same location instead of having everybody running like crazy all over the city ? I already buy the idea&nbsp;!</p>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[Revisit Julien Fournié "Premières Couleurs" ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>Remember 11 months ago Julien Fourni&eacute; first participation to the Haute Couture Fashionweek, this is a perfect occasion to revisit the Spring/Summer 2011 fun couture collection presented in Paris on January 2011.&nbsp;Julien pays homage to a colored woman of whose silhouette is enhanced by bright colors.</p>
<p>Most of the wellknown style codes of Julien were part of this Collection, short and sculptural line as the hot-pants, windowed back that appear on a pink-purple leather jacket in middle of the show, a genuine leitmotiv revealed also by the plunging slits of light dresses, including zips turned into decorations.</p>
<p>First Colors was also a blend of magenta, shocking rose, turquoise, orange and yellow as part of the palet used by Julien Fourni&eacute;.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/32806231?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" width="621" height="348"></iframe></p>

<p><br />The sound track contribute also to the incredible energy of this collection presentation. I will only mention few songs that appear at the start by order:</p>
<p>-First song, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Never Knew Love Like This Before</span> by <strong>Stephanie Mills</strong><br />-Second Song, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thinking of you</span> by <strong>Sister Siedge</strong></p>
<p>Definitevely the most 360&deg; colored Haute Couture FashionShow ever.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[3 Questions to François Quentin]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p><strong>Celia Newhouse had the opportunity to interview Fran&ccedil;ois Quentin at Dassault Syst&egrave;mes European Customer Forum which took place on November 22-23 in Disneyland.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Celia Newhouse:</strong> What&rsquo;s in for you with FashionLab?</p>
<p><strong>Fran&ccedil;ois Quentin:</strong>&nbsp;First I want to say that I am very happy to be a partner of FashionLab. The fact that the whole team dedicates so much time in me and my company proves that Dassault Syst&egrave;mes is very attentive to their customers. <br /><br />I am fascinated by this energy, this passion and also by the products. Developing tomorrow&rsquo;s technology with FashionLab is an incredible opportunity and is the road to success. I really feel like I am at the heart of watch making. <br /><br />But to answer your question using facts. We can try things on every aspect of the product lifecycle: the design but also the customer experience. When I was first using DS solutions I knew what I was doing and where I wanted to go. Now with the FashionLab &ndash; I still know where I want to go &ndash; but I&rsquo;m opening new doors &ndash; like doing shopping experience &ndash; this is opening new opportunities and taking my company to a new direction/dimension.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CN:</strong> What does innovation means in the watch industry?<br /><br /><strong>FQ:&nbsp;</strong> First you have to know that innovation plays a very big role in my industry. Everybody wants to offer something new and something innovative. That is: new and useful.<br /><br />For example: this is a complication called "minute repetition." It was created to tell the time in the dark (or rather hear the time in the dark).<br /><br />So my idea started also with creating something unique: I was looking more at something on the face of the watch. I started looking at an old complication called jumping minutes and hours.<br /><br />It shows the time in digital form - numbers instead of hands. The problem with this complication is the very small display of the numbers. Traditionally, in this complication, we have three disks, one for minutes, one for tens of minutes, one for an hour. The numbers are written on the edge of the disks the position of these discs in a watch implies small disks and therefore very small numbers.<br /><br />I created the first 4-digit numerical display with large numbers. The challenge was improved legibility, and efficiency of reading, respecting the natural order of the numbers, from left to right in the center of the display. For this, I used sets of disks (like carousels).<br /><br /><strong>CN:</strong> How 3D helps you making the 4N?<br /><br /><strong>FQ:</strong>&nbsp;The 4N is an expensive watch; I can&rsquo;t afford to produce several prototypes and to do live tests.&nbsp; Watch making uses simple mechanism.&nbsp; It is the high number of these mechanisms put together in a very limited space, and they all have fit in. And that generates the complexity. <br /><br />But 3D and virtual software give me 2 things: the virtual simulation and the possibility to manage changes quickly.<br /><br />One other important point in my job, in my work I&rsquo;m always looking at new materials and new movements and new complications, so 3D is key to test all these.&nbsp; <br />So I had my model in 3D and I used it as a collaborative tool and presented it to Renaud et Papi in Le Locle in Switzerland with my 3D model.&nbsp; It actually added credibility to my model. It has all the right level of details to communicate with the manufacturing team. Without CATIA, I wouldn&rsquo;t have this partnership with Renaud and Papi.<br /><br />The high quality rendering of each component helps confirm the feasibility of the design with manufacturers. <br />So I would say that it helps me shape what I may or may not do in the future!</p>

    <title><![CDATA[My 3D Drawing Experience]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p><strong>Going from 2D to 3D sketching helps&nbsp; make what&rsquo;s in a designer&rsquo;s head come true faster. And in this process, faster can also mean better.</strong></p>
<p>Like many children, I started drawing at around age 3,&nbsp; way before writing. I never really stopped since that time. It was long and also exciting to learn how to draw. For some years now, as a fashion illustrator and as a fashion designer, drawing has become a priceless means of expression in my eyes. Drawings and paintings can often convey emotions better than words (at least in my case). In order to achieve my goals as a professional fashion designer, I also produce several sketches every day. These drawings are in fact means of communications with my team, with the seamstresses, but also with the director or producer of a future runway show, with a supplier of fabric, with an embroiderer, etc.... Whether they are more technical or artistically crafted, these sketches convey precise ideas and have to translate into a shape what has come to my mind at a precise moment in time.<br /><br />In the creative process of designing clothes, our daily tasks constantly start from a &laquo; flat &raquo; drawing done on paper. We then traditionally transform this 2D image of a virtual garment into a 3D reality, that is done most times, with a &laquo; dummy &raquo; clothing piece molded on a mannequin with &laquo; fake &raquo; fabric. This is the time when we finalize the volumes of a particular design, when we cut, drape, inlay, adjust, interpreting the 2D sketch to make it into a piece of clothing, checking on the way that the proportions we had in mind originally do work out from every angle. In this process, designer and head seamstress often work together closely to check on the garment&rsquo;s wearability (like for instance: is it possible to raise your arms with such sleeves and shoulders), on top of checking the general aspect of the piece, from an aesthetic point of view. Then, the various pieces composing the garment are disassembled and, following the exact shape of every &laquo; flat &raquo;&nbsp; &laquo; fake &raquo; fabric piece, we cut the real fabric we intended the garment to be made in, and assemble them the same way as they were assembled on the &laquo; dummy &raquo;, to create a first prototype. This prototype and the dummy will then both be used again to create the pattern from which each piece will be reproduced.<br />&nbsp;<br />What can be hard in the 2D drawing process, particularly when you are not familiar with this entire routine, is to&nbsp; translate the 3D piece you have in your mind on a mere piece of paper using a pencil. Even with a good sketch, many things need to be explained before your team can start to make your sketch become 3D on the mannequin. I am lucky enough to &laquo; think in 3D &raquo;. I know when I cut a round train for instance that the semi-circle will be perfect on both sides even if I cut it without checking or without putting one half on the other one to create the same round shape on each side of it. <br /><br />Trying to sketch in 3D for the first time, when we started to develop these FashionLab tools was merely fantastic! My &laquo; 3D ideas &raquo; were coming to life faster than I could have thought, taking shape in 3D volumes. I could make the drawing turn around and literally mould it into a sculpture before my eyes, using a digital pen and tablet. I could not believe it: not only could I create a silhouette, but also, check from every angle how it could look around the body. Of course, it took me time to get used to the new tools, and if you are a bad sketcher, 3D drawing will not solve your creative problem. However, if you have talent and experience in the art of drawing, the 3D digital tool I am proud of having contributed to create, will empower your possibilities and help you think in 3D.</p>
<p>For some time now, I have realized that the experience of drawing can be felt at best in one gesture by a calligrapher. In Japan, for instance, you can sense in one sole gesture, that a precise calligrapher expresses an experience rich with thirty years of training. This is also the reason why I believe that speed, in this very specific meaning, is also precious in the creative process we use in fashion design. Ideas that can transform into a textile shape often benefit from mastering simple movements. 3D digital drawing can help us all to create in a better, faster and more precise way. It will certainly improve the way we work in a team, making all our designs more &laquo; talkative &raquo; as each and every participant in the design studio and atelier will look at it from their own point of view. Bringing together technology and imagination is our goal at Dassault Syst&egrave;mes&rsquo; FashionLab. Software engineers continuously require my feedback when they create new tools to be used by fashion designers. And I always try to keep the designing process jubilant. On this way, sharing your design with others as fast as you can, is of the utmost importance. A 3D sketch can help keep fresh what&rsquo;s fresh on a designer&rsquo;s mind&hellip;. After you will have learnt its specific tools and tried these virtual tools yourself, I would not be surprised if you would think that they are just as irreplaceable as your drawing technique combined with your pencil and paper.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[H&M Launches « Girl With Dragon Tattoo » capsule collection]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>H&amp;M&rsquo;s used to collaborate with fashion designer. But for the first time, they partnering with a movie. The inspiration source is the American remake of &laquo;&nbsp;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&nbsp;&raquo;, a David Fincher thriller based on Swedish author Stieg Larsson's novel of the same name&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Trish Summerville, the film&rsquo;s costume designer, worked with H&amp;M to sign a 30 piece collection inspired by the main female movie character, the androgynous cyberpunk hacker &laquo;&nbsp;Lisbeth Salander&nbsp;&raquo;.</p>
<p>Leather jackets and pants, battled pants, slouchy tees, hoodies all in industrial shades like black, anhtracite, and blood red, as depicted in Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy as well as bickers accessoiries like jewelry and shoes will form the collection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salander&rsquo;s look is very real and very lived in, with pieces that her character has worn for a long time, like her jackets that act as her armour to shield her from the world. I wanted the collection to have the essence and strength of Salander, with a fashion edge, and I&rsquo;m pleased with the result. My goal is for women to find pieces in it that they love and then mix them with their own wardrobe to create their own personal style.&nbsp;&raquo; Summerville said.</p>
<p>The collection debut exclusively at the boutique Colette in Paris on November 28, with its own dedicated in-store area. The collection will be available from December 14 in Divided departments in around 100 H&amp;M stores worldwide, as well as online.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Everybody wants a label.]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p><em>The need of &ldquo;Made in&rdquo; labels has never been such a hot topic.&nbsp; And everybody wants it for their own personal or political reasons.</em></p>
<p>Origin labeling is not mandatory in Europe.&nbsp; In May this year a new rule was adopted to clearly flag fur, leather and any animal derived materials on textile product labels. But that really will come into effect in 2 &frac12; years to give the industry time to adjust.&nbsp; The European Parliament has commissioned the European Commission to lead a study on the feasibility of implementing origin labels on textile products.&nbsp; But we will have to be a little patient: their &nbsp;report is due by September 2013!</p>
<p>Meanwhile politicians of all parties AND consumers all want their labels. Mostly a label that will say: &ldquo;Made in My country&rdquo;.&nbsp; In Europe this trend bears a nasty reminiscing taste of right-wing patriotic slogans. &nbsp;But today this label is also used for much more progressive and open minded purposes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s another way of saying: &ldquo;buy local&rdquo;. An argument well used by the green parties &ndash; and many of us too! - and one that makes absolute sense to reduce CO2 emissions on our planet.&nbsp; Economists and moderate politicians &ndash; right and left &ndash; want their label in order to fuel an alarming decaying employment rate, hoping this will bring manufacturing back to Europe.&nbsp; And then some consumers want their label because they <em>just want to know what they&rsquo;re buying</em>!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But essentially having this label would help the apparel industry reinvent itself. &nbsp;The luxury market needs to guarantee it will keep its growth rate tomorrow and heavily relies on these quality labels.&nbsp; &ldquo;Made in Italy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Made in France&rdquo; certify the quality.&nbsp; Luxury houses such as Hermes and Chanel owe part of their growth to their strategy of keeping the manufacturing local hence justifying their prices too.&nbsp; Non-European luxury brands like Ralph Lauren recently said that sourcing their fabric out of Italy added value to their products.</p>
<p>A label for the environment. A label for better quality.&nbsp; A label for more employment. A label to inform.&nbsp; For once we seem to have reached a consensus.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[No more laundry? A new fabric that cleans itself when exposed to sunlight]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>Two chinese Scientists have developed a method to create cotton fabrics that clean and deodorize themselves when exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>Mingce Long and Deyong Wu, from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, say their fabric uses a coating made from a compound of titanium dioxide. Their report describes "<em>A cotton fabric coated with nanoparticles made from a compound of titanium dioxide and nitrogen</em>". They show that fabric, coated with the material, removes an orange dye stain when exposed to sunlight.&nbsp;Additional nanoparticles composed of silver and iodine accelerates the discoloration process. They also add that the coating remains intact after multiple washing and drying (although we thought the main purpose was that we wouldn't need to do that anymore).</p>
<p>The two scientists note self-cleaning cotton fabrics have been made in the past, but at this time, the fabrics self-clean process worked only when exposed to ultraviolet rays. That's why they set out to develop a new cotton fabric that cleans itself when exposed to ordinary sunlight.</p>
<p>Should we keep your washer as of yet?</p>
<p>Well, in the end, the story doesn't tell how the fabrics looks like neither if this technology will be massively used. Maybe the real question is: are we mentally prepared to wear wardrobe that rids itself of stains and dirt when exposed to sun?</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Valentino Garavani's Virtual Museum ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<div>
<h3><strong>An immersive 3-D technology to showcase&nbsp;five decades of Valentino Garavani archives</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of the typical exhibitions in typical &ldquo;hardware&rdquo; museums, Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti &nbsp;has used an immersive 3-D technology to showcase five decades of Valentino Garavani archives&rdquo;. Said to be the first digital exhibition developed by a fashion designer, the virtual museum was introduced on December 6th at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p>
<h3><strong>The Valentino&rsquo;s museum launch comes at a significant moment for the fashion industry</strong></h3>
<p>The public interest in fashion exhibitions is a current trend. Last summer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the succeeded and lucrative&nbsp;&ldquo;Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty&rdquo; exhibition attracted more than 650,000 paying visitors. Last fall, Gucci has opened a private museum housed in a 14th-century building in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, Italy, and many others prestigious brands, like Vuitton or Chanel, now have no hesitations to communicate about their legacy using exhibitions as&nbsp; a modus operandi.</p>
<p>It took two years to finalize the project. The design has been done in partnership with Novacom Associ&eacute;s, a French agency specializing in interactive marketing, and with the collaboration of Patrick Kinmonth and Antonio Monfreda. The museum was funded entirely by Garavani and Giammetti at a reported cost of several million dollars, but is free to access. It serves no direct commercial purpose and exists for the sole purpose of making the Valentino&rsquo;s archives globally available to everyone with the online facilities offering unlimited interconnections and crossreferences possibilities.</p>
<h3><strong>In the physical world this museum would stretch over 10,000 square meters</strong></h3>
<p>The downloadable desktop application&nbsp;includes :</p>
<ul>
<li>a library containing 5,000 images of dresses</li>
<li>photographs of the clothes, and of the celebrities who wore them</li>
<li>drawings and sketching from the designer&rsquo;s hand</li>
<li>nearly 180 fashion show videos. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Take a&nbsp;Masterclass with Valentino</strong></h3>
<p>The virtual museum is also a place to study with the master himself if you choose to go to &ldquo;A Masterclass with Valentino&rdquo;, a digital tuition in which the design icon talks about creation process using some of his most famous couture dresses (like the bridal dress of Jacqueline Kennedy for her marriage to A.Onassis in 1968), assisted with Natalia Vodianova as a model. &ldquo;It is the first time there as been a virtual fashion museum &mdash; and people can interact,&rdquo; says Mr. Giammetti. New interactive concepts should be introduced every two months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want Valentino to be just from the past,&rdquo; Mr. Giammetti says of his project. &ldquo;We want something alive for the future.&rdquo;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[New Technology Breakthroughs for Fashion Design]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p><strong>Everyone is talking about the Spring-Summer 2012 Paris Couture Fashion Week! </strong><br /><strong>Julien Fourni&eacute; Fashion Show was held yesterday, January 24th, at the Showcase. The show was fantastic, and we, at FashionLab, had the opportunity to present the first results of our collaboration with Julien Fourni&eacute;.</strong></p>
<p>Over the past year, we have been working with Julien Fourni&eacute; to develop 3D solutions, in grade of reproducing <strong>fabrics&rsquo; reactions</strong> in real life with digital tools. Our engineers have designed an experience to develop a virtual piece in 3D, in order to compose a <strong>3D silhouette</strong> using sketching&nbsp;techniques based on the designers&rsquo; drawing know how.</p>
<p><a id="yui_3_7_3_3_1357748443211_1039" class="rapidnofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79884939@N02/8365117880/in/photostream" data-rapid_p="42" data-track="photo-click"><img id="yui_3_7_3_3_1357748443211_1038" class="pc_img" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8235/8365117880_b63695575a_m.jpg" alt="Extase 3 robes  00" width="240" height="135" border="0" data-thumbdata="" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a id="yui_3_7_3_3_1357748443211_1061" class="rapidnofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79884939@N02/8365119548/in/photostream" data-rapid_p="26" data-track="photo-click"><img id="yui_3_7_3_3_1357748443211_1060" class="pc_img" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8496/8365119548_234291350c_m.jpg" alt="Extase 3 robes  07" width="240" height="131" border="0" data-thumbdata="" /></a></p>
<p>With this new tool, a fashion designer can <strong>explore lines</strong> which he usually sketches in two dimensions only with a full volume rendering. The designer can work and visualize from every possible angle he chooses in the digital world. With their tool, designers can also <strong>build draping, add embroideries or rhinestones, calculate precisely their projected use of materials</strong>. Thanks to an original online digital library, the fashion designer and its studio can also investigate materials to visualize, study, improve a virtual prototype before they make the real-life dummy and piece, accelerating and enhancing thus their creative process before they get to work on the real-life mannequin.</p>

<p><br />And what about yourself, do you think that 3D will help you go beyond the limits of your creativity?</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Prada 24h Museum by Francesco Vezzoli]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<div>
<h3><span>Only open for a 24-hour period</span></h3>
<p>Prada presented the <a href="http://www.24hoursmuseum.com" target="_blank">"24h Museum"</a>, designed by Francesco Vezzoli with AMO, Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas' think tank. The "24h Museum" was launched&nbsp;during the&nbsp;Haute Couture Spring/Summer Fashion Week&nbsp;in Paris at 8:30pm,&nbsp;on Tuesday 24 January for 24 hours, and closed its doors yesterday, Wednesday 25 January at exactly 8:30.</p>
<p>Presented in the historic&nbsp;Palais d'I&eacute;na, it was the first time a contemporary art show took place in this building, designed by Auguste Perret between 1936 and 1946. Today home of the &ldquo;Conseil Economique, Social et Environnemental&rdquo;, the third French parliament<em>,&nbsp;</em>the place was originally designed to be a museum.</p>
<p>AMO's installation for the "24h Museum" was divided in three sections, each inspired by a particular type of museum space: historic, contemporary and forgotten. The three sections were instrument to the sequence of events &nbsp;that take place during 24 hours in different areas of the ground floor of the Palais d'I&eacute;na. The central space is a large metal cage made from grills and neon lights that encloses the work by Francesco Vezzoli.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>A three sections set up &ndash;historic, contemporary and forgotten</h3>
<p>Vezzoli created a "non-existent museum" where he showed his personal tribute to the femininity through interpretations of classical sculptures that make reference to contemporary divas. <em>"They are my icons&rdquo;</em> he says, <em>"turned into sculptures and placed on marble pedestals".</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The main space, a large cage made from grills and neon lights looked like A Clockwork Orange set mixed with a NYC Studio 54 feeling, hosted a series of neoclassical statues&nbsp;with puzzle heads of the celebrities Vezzoli has worked with (from Britney Spears to Courtney Love or Cate Blanchett to name few of them) that&nbsp;light up from the inside, turning from white to pink and red.</li>
<li>At the top of the stairway, epicentre of the building, Vezzoli is placed a majestic sculpture of a female, reinterpreted with the features of a mysterious goddess.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Salon des refuses&rdquo; third part of the museum located in a hidden part of the ground floor, featured imaginary relics of Vezzoli&rsquo;s art, and was turned as a small disco-club the evening of the 24th.</li>
</ul>
<h3>An ephemeral "Total Museum"</h3>
<p>The museum result was a collage of experiences and spaces of diverse size and quality: an imaginary and ephemeral &ldquo;total museum&rdquo;. But the steady stream of visitors was the real show. <em>&ldquo;This time, the audience gets to react,&rdquo;</em> Vezzoli says before the opening. <em>&ldquo;They are the performance.&rdquo;</em><br /><br />Yesterday, when the clock completed it&rsquo;s 24 hour turn, everything disappeared to never pop up again.</p>
<p>Francesco Vezzoli concluded : <em>&ldquo;I try to never repeat myself&rdquo;</em></p>

    <title><![CDATA[What to Wear if You Are Plus Size? Stylish Solutions for Plus-Size Girls]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3>It's not so easy being chic, but it can be an epic battle when you're not a skinny woman.</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an option anymore to be struggled with weight and to try to camouflage your curves. But like anyone, you are expecting to found perfectly fitted tops, sleek pants, nice bathing suits and stylish dresses or just a pair of boots that won&rsquo;t struggle your calves.</p>

<p>In the US, the Retail Boutique Monif C. Plus Sizes Manhattan Store is &ldquo;the first contemporary, sexy, trendy designer clothing store for plus size fashionistas&rdquo; in the City.</p>
<p>Monif&rsquo;s spring 2012 collection offers a fantastic variety of garments that are sexy without being too obvious. And it&rsquo;s not a surprise if Monif was named best plus-size designer at <a href="http://www.fffweek.com/2012/home">&ldquo;Full Figured Fashion Week&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>The brand is also carried in several specialty boutiques around the country from Louisiana to Wisconsin, as well as online via the <a href="http://www.monifc.com/">Monif&rsquo;C website</a>.</p>
<h3>When you are a plus size figure, shopping could be as difficult as depressive.</h3>
<p>The most recurrent, most difficult wardrobe challenge for ALL girls even the skinny ones, is certainly finding that perfect, &ldquo;every occasion&rdquo; pair of lengthening and slimming pant as well as a magic butt-embracing jeans.</p>
<p>The French Brand <a href="http://www.castaluna.com/">Castaluna</a> just launch it&rsquo;s just online boutique, the very first e-shop entirely dedicated for plus size woman. A big &ldquo;Premiere&rdquo; in a country of most of the brands offer garments until size 12. The brand is far away of the old &ldquo;solely to hide the body&rdquo; song. Big sized French woman will finally now have choice between nicely fitted basics, designer dresses, cute lingerie, as well as leather, cashmere or maternity lines and accessories&rsquo;.</p>
<h3>XL&rsquo;s girls want to have fun too!</h3>
<p>To fight the fitting room stress syndrome and to bring some fun in their shops, the Canadian <a href="http://www.1-plus.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-1Plus_CA-Site/default/Home-Show?id=PE">Pennington</a> made a surprise to its customers. As you can see on the video below, as soon as shoppers arrived in front of the mirror in the fitting room, they saw two &ldquo;Chippendale style&rsquo;s firefighters&rdquo; descend from poles on either side of their reflection and making a show, offering &nbsp;flowers or drawing cute little heart sketch. This interactive fitting room with magic mirrors installation by <a href="http://www.ddbcanada.com/">DDB Canada</a> was done with motion-sensors and mirrored TV screens and used AR augmented reality animation.</p>
<p>So, ladies, test them all!&nbsp;Plus size fashion&nbsp;is just a click away.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Exploring use cases for electronic clothes]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>Adafruit Industries, an open-source hardware company, recently&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/659">announced</a>&nbsp;a new wearable electronic platform that is Arduino compatible. Called Flora, the 1.75&Prime; device will soon be available to Adafruit&rsquo;s community of makers, hackers, crafters, artists, designers and engineers. Using the open source device, they&rsquo;ll be able to create a matrix of up to hundreds or someday, more than 1,000 small LED &ldquo;pixels&rdquo; and embed them it into fabric.</p>
<p>Inventor Limor Fried, named one of the &ldquo;Most influential Women in Technology&rdquo; by Fast Company, said that she envisions a world where people carry handbags with text or video, or wear TV screens on their T-shirts.</p>
<p>Embedding screens and sensors into clothing is not a new idea, but the approach Adafruit presents could be a boost for a concept that is not without technical hurdles (How do you wash an electrified shirt?). Fried was once part of the wearable computing group at MIT and if you&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/659">look at the specs</a>, she designed the platform to be beginner-friendly, fabric-friendly, and loaded with standardized hardware and protocols, such as built-in USB and USB HID support, and forthcoming iPhone/iPad/Android apps. The kit even includes premium stainless steel thread.</p>
<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/01/future-of-fun-flora-wearable/">interview</a>&nbsp;on Wired, Fried and her partner Phillip Torrone, Adafruit&rsquo;s creative director, discussed how Flora could be used to control electronics, such as lights, sensors, and Internet communications.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean, what do people really want? They want to be rock stars. They want to wear jackets with flashing lights that have flexible LED displays that can play whole videos on them,&rdquo; Fried told Wired.</p>
<p>That may be true for some and there&rsquo;s no doubt the Burning Man crowd would be among the first to join artists and fashion designers in that trajectory. But would the mainstream shop for clothing laced with flexible screens or t-shits that could loop YouTube clips? Perhaps, but there are a lot of applications across many domains and embedded electronic could ultimately improve our lives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fashion/Art&nbsp;</strong>- The best example is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX9FOGFxN9A">Galaxy Dress</a>, which Singularity Hub&nbsp;<a href="http://singularityhub.com/2010/04/06/the-10-most-amazing-electronic-clothes-of-the-century/">called</a>&nbsp;an &ldquo;extravagant example of what happens when technology collides full on with haute couture.&rdquo; There are also light-up bras and shirts with embedded speakers. This use case is most prominent since integrated electronics is still a novelty.</li>
<li><strong>Branding</strong>&nbsp;- Embroidered or silk-screened logos not enough? Nothing will express your intense brand affinity or adoration for a product or ad than&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOOGXknyKdk">using your body as an electronic billboard</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Entertainment -&nbsp;</strong>If in the future, you can watch a music video on your sleeve with the same quality and resolution as your portable handheld device, then why not?</li>
<li><strong>Communications</strong>&nbsp;- Military applications are most noteworthy as high-tech soldiers increasingly don sophisticated gadgets and weapons that are linked together. For example, Ohio State University researchers have&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/emergingtech/an-antenna-in-your-clothes-for-more-reliable-communications/2765">created a lightweight wearable antenna</a>&nbsp;that could eventually replace bulky conventional antennas.</li>
<li><strong>Health/Data logging</strong>&nbsp;- Wearable sensors are essential for monitoring body signals, medical diagnosis, mHealth applications, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/emergingtech/7-things-you-should-know-about-body-area-networks-bans/1946">body area networks</a>. They could also be used in treatment. For instance, there&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecuad.ca/node/2873">scarf</a>&nbsp;that is designed to calm Autistic sufferers using textures, sounds and smells.</li>
<li><strong>Gaming/</strong><strong>Controllers</strong>&nbsp;- Vibrating game controllers are no match for haptic clothing. A few years ago, Philips Electronics created a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/emergingtech/haptic-jacket-lets-you-feel-the-movies/1359">jacket lined with vibration motors</a>&nbsp;allow you to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; games and movies. From MP3 player/smartphone controls to wearable gestural interfaces like&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SixthSense">SixthSense,</a>&nbsp;such interfaces could someday be as common as the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen.</li>

    <title><![CDATA[Scratch-n-Sniff Raspberry Scented Denim… for grown-ups!]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong>A pair of jeans that scents raspberry</strong></h3>
<p>Few years ago, there were projects about <a href="http://gizmodo.com/036153/scented-smart-clothes">scented clothes that change with your mood</a>&hellip;</p>
<p>The Canadian company&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nakedandfamousdenim.com/">Naked &amp; Famous Denim</a>&nbsp;has now manufactured and developed a model of jeans with built in &ldquo;scratch-n-sniff&rdquo; technology.</p>
<p><strong>Naked &amp; Famous Denim</strong>&nbsp;is known to use only good quality and rare denim fabrics from Japan. The prestigious mill in Japan, from which they import all their fabric uses a combination of old school and modern methods and practices, and is committed to producing only the best (and most expensive) denim in the world. So much culture and history is poured into the fabric so that it can be appreciated by the denim purist.</p>
<p>The brand that advertises to keep all their jeans raw and simple (no washes, no embroidery, no gimmicks &ldquo; just the best fabric in the world combined with modern fits&rdquo;) just launched an extreme fantasy denim.</p>
<h3><strong>This project bridges the disciplines of fashion, analytical chemistry, nanotechnology and perfumery</strong></h3>
<p>At the first glance, nothing to be notices but a fashionable made in Canada basic piece of denim. But if you scratch the fabric, the jeans will smell like raspberry candy. <strong>The effect is achieved by coating the fabric with a special product that contains perfumed microcapsules</strong>. It is applied and then baked into the denim. As you scratch the garment, the scent is released. The coating will last up to 5 washes depending on how you care for jeans and how often you wear them.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>The story doesn&rsquo;t tell if the designer was an avid collector of 80's "<em>scratch and sniff" </em>stickers neither if the future clothes could use engineered scents to finally change our moods or <a href="http://www.innovationnewsdaily.com/314-future-clothes-could-use-engineered-scents-to-change-mood-and-enhance-memory-.html">enhance our memory</a>.</p>
<p>Do you think scented clothes have a future in the fashion industry?</p>

<h3>The bag can generate up to 2 Watts, enough to power a cellphone, a MP3 player or a camera</h3>
<p>The technology &nbsp;uses one hundred miniature <strong>photovoltaic cells</strong> sewed on classic&nbsp; material. The cells are part of the handbag design and can generate up to 2 Watts, enough to power a cellphone, a MP3 player or a camera. A <strong>lithium-ion battery</strong> hidden in a small pocket keeps the energy surplus.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Wearable Invitations to Touch]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3>A new idea is born about the interaction we can have with our garments and with other people...</h3>
<p>Especially the ones we love.</p>
<p><strong>Drew Stanley</strong>, &nbsp;a New York based product and fashion designer bring this new style called&nbsp;<strong>Touchables</strong>. The entire collection invite interaction and gets people to get closer and touch each other.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Coupling Shirts&rdquo; are sweatshirts that have&nbsp;<strong>slit pockets</strong>&nbsp;in areas that couples normally lay their hands when together, as the other part of the collection feature&nbsp;<strong>laser-cut hole-pattern</strong>&nbsp;T-Shirts, that &nbsp;&ldquo;is meant to simulate the feelings that bodies make on each other during contact.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The sensory response&nbsp;to touch makes experiences more memorable</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Touch is an important part of building relationships&rdquo; says Drew, &ldquo;As the world gets more<br />wired with digital outlets of communication, opportunities for face-to-face<br />experiences and relational interactions are in danger&rdquo;.</p>
<h3>Wearable Invitations to Touch</h3>
<p>These concepts are a statement on Design&rsquo;s potential to play a pivotal&nbsp;role in creating scenarios that encourage and nurture physical connection&nbsp;amongst humans; understanding that these moments of physical comfort&nbsp;and intimacy teach some of life&rsquo;s most valuable assets like empathy, rapport&nbsp;and altruism.</p>
<p><strong>Touchables</strong> are part of an ongoing study on intimacy from Drew Stanley.</p>
<p>Still a prototype the collection isn&rsquo;t available for purchase yet.</p>
<p>For more informations, you can contact&nbsp; Drew Stanley :&nbsp;<a href="http://design-milk.com/touchables/drewstanley.contact@gmail.com" target="_blank">drewstanley.contact@gmail.com</a></p>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[3D-Printed Bikini by Continuum Fashion]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><span><span><a href="http://www.continuumfashion.com/">Continuum Fashion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Shapeways</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>have designed the first&nbsp;</span></span>consumer ready-to-wear 3D-printed garment.</h3>
<p>It's a swimsuit and it's name is&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.continuumfashion.com/N12.html"><strong>N12 Bikin</strong>i</a>.</p>
<p>The swimsuit was named for the material it's made out of, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shapeways.com/materials/white_strong_flexible">Nylon 12</a>.&nbsp;<span>This solid material is created by the SLS 3D printing process and is a perfect choice as</span>&nbsp;it is waterproof and remarkably comfortable when wet.</p>
<p><span><span>The bikini's design&nbsp;</span></span>was built in&nbsp;Rhino 3D CAD software, using a special algorithm to create the structure of the Nylon fabric.</p>
<h3><span>White, strong, and flexible</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pratical terms, thousands of circular plates are connected by thin strings, creating a wholly new material that holds its form as well as being flexible. The layout of the circle pattern was achieved through custom written code that lays out the circles according to the curvature of the surface. In this way, the aesthetic design is completely derived from the structural design.</p>
<p><span>The N12 bikini is now available with&nbsp;<span>a selection of sizes</span>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/continuum">Continuum online store</a><span>.</span><span><br /></span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[3D Print collection - Red-Blue / Cyan Anaglyph Simple Style 3D Glasses Required]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong><a href="http://www.nouio.com/2012S-S-TRIDULUM" target="_blank">Noumenon "Tridulum" 2012 spring summer</a> is a 3D printed collection.</strong></h3>
<p>The brand started in 2011 and was created by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nouio.com/" target="_blank">Tri Nouio</a>, a young Taiwanese fashion designer. He studied at Shih Chien University, and graduated in 2011. His collections are entirely produced and designed in Taiwan. For the 2012 spring summer, he&nbsp;created a collection of super minimal garments with 3D prints.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>A Combination of Technology and Art</strong></h3>
<p>Noumenon's garments combine art, technology and fashion in the use of 3D imagery on fabric. The futuristic aesthetics and classic silhouettes mashup creates an unique signature style.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>3D Motifs Influenced by Nature</strong></h3>
<p>"The image is easier to convey than the message", Tri Nouio says, "so I adapted 3D technology to develop motifs influenced by nature for my collection. This piece have been developed by combining the familiarity of nature with new technology and is intended as an ironic statement that modern technology cannot protect nature. Worn with 3D glasses, it is intended to be a distraction from the human form."&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Live from BaselWorld!]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p><strong>FashionLab is right now at the most important fair in the world in the watch making and high fine jewelry industry.</strong></p>
<p>Here the exhibitors spaces are massive and look more like a Store than a booth! From the Hall 2 where well-known brands such as Patek Philippe or Harry Winston showcase their new watch, to the Palace area where independent watch maker such as Fran&ccedil;ois Quentin presents the 4N in the Watch gallery, there is a deep feeling of luxury, known-how and art!&nbsp; Because a watch is no longer just a tool to give time but a real jewelry and social differentiator, all brands have a distinguishing and representative area.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;not to be missed&rdquo; at BaselWorld this year are definitely the Opus 12 from Harry Winston, one of most original mechanical concept, and the Seiko watch, integrating a GPS that enables to change time zones automatically.</p>
<p>But to go back on the Palace, and the Watch Gallery, where our partner Fran&ccedil;ois Quentin is presenting the 4N, the spirit is different: very simple and friendly, still showcasing very complex mechanism and original pieces. We can really feel the synergy between the different Watch designers there. This area is the place where independent watch maker can highlight their new creation.</p>
<p><br />In general, being at BaselWorld is a good way to understand the watch industry world and network. FashionLab is pleased to be part of this community and looking forward being at the next edition of BaselWorld!</p>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[Anecdote at BaselWorld]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Anecdote at BaselWorld, story by Thierry Rouf, Head of FashionLab Research<br /></strong><strong>Baselworld &ndash; Wednesday March 14, 2012 &ndash; 2.30 p.m.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>We were at Basel, Switzerland, Stand P03 (Watch Gallery), Palace, BaselWorld. The context: an appointment between Fran&ccedil;ois Quentin and a journalist.</strong></p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois&nbsp; was discussing with the journalist to explain and describe the specificities of the 4N. The discussion was based on the physical model produced by Renaud &amp; Papi. In addition to the physical model, there was a large Samsung screen where we showcased images of the watch.</p>
<p>By watching the zoomed images on the screen, the journalist said: "It is a nice picture of your watch. Which photo studio you are you working with?"</p>
<p>First reaction from Fran&ccedil;ois was to look at me very briefly to check if we got the same feeling. As he saw the surprise on my face he automatically reacted by asking a question: "What do you mean by photo studio, what you see on this screen is not a photo but a virtual image, a 3D model!"<br /><br />I took this opportunity to introduce myself as the Head of FashionLab Research at Dassault Syst&egrave;mes. I engaged the conversation and started manipulating the 4N 3D model in Live.<br /><br />Right after the demo, it was clear to him: he was facing with a software able to reproduce the exact model, in 3D, in its context, and in real time&hellip; <strong>When 3D becomes reality!</strong></p>

    <title><![CDATA[3D Printed Shoes]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3>Two Swedish students of&nbsp;the two most prestigious&nbsp;Stockholm's&nbsp;design school&nbsp;have collaborated to produce wearable 3D printed shoes.&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.beckmans.se/naim-josefi/" target="_blank">Naim Josefi</a></strong>&nbsp;of Beckmans School&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Souzan Youssouf</strong>&nbsp;of Konstfack school,&nbsp;designed and modelled the 3D printed shoes for <strong><a href="http://production3dprinters.com/sls/selective-laser-sintering" target="_blank">Selective Laser Sintering</a></strong>. The two designers have chosen a&nbsp;<strong>polyamid material</strong>&nbsp;for their creation, and produced five&nbsp;custom tailored&nbsp;pairs for the models who introduced Naim Josefi's "Melonia" collection, during Stockholm SS 2010 Fashion Show.</p>
<h3>Rapidity and Sustainability</h3>
<p>The video describes the process of rapid&nbsp;prototyped shoes and emphasizes the idea of fashions items as a&nbsp;sustainable means of production.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[New FLORA Wearable Electronics Platform]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>The open-source hardware company <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/" target="_blank">Adafruit Industries</a>, recently&nbsp;announced&nbsp;its new seweable electronic device called <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/659" target="_blank">FLORA</a>.</p>
<h3>The inventor, is an MIT Engineer,<a href="http://www.ladyada.net/bio/index.html" target="_blank"> Limor Fried</a>, must known as LadyAda.</h3>
<p>Named one of the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/women-in-tech/2011/entrepreneurs" target="_blank">&ldquo;Most influential Women in Technology&rdquo; by Fast Company</a>, Fried, who <span>was a member of the MIT wearables group and likes to sew,</span>&nbsp;thinks that even if wearable electronics means serious applications for health, medicine and other technical fields, it doesn&rsquo;t need not be just used for those activities and could also be used as part of fashion. She says that &ldquo;she envisions a world where people carry handbags with text or video, or wear TV screens on their T-shirts.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A small, user friendly wearable electronic device</h3>
<p>In practical terms, <strong>the FLORA is a small 1.75 inches across computing device</strong>.&nbsp;It can be sewn into any material, garment or accessory and since it does not use FTDI headers (headers of any kind sticking out can grab and tear fabric.) it can be used with any fabrics, even the more delicates.</p>
<p>Thanks to its <strong>built-in USB port</strong>, the FLORA is fledgling users friendly : you plug it in to program it, it just shows up. Compatible with Windows, Mac or Linux PC for programming, anyone should be able to use it with only its imagination as a limit. And with its <strong>USB HID support</strong>, you will be able to&nbsp;<strong>control it from your cell phone</strong> with the Apps for iOS and Android.</p>
<h3>Made in New York City</h3>
<p>The FLORA is made in NYC at Adafruit and&nbsp;will soon be available. The kit will come with Adafruit's support, tutorials and projects.<strong>&nbsp;Adafruit has dozens of projects that will be released with its new device in 2012</strong>&nbsp;and has staff entirely dedicated to creating tutorials and projects for use with it!</p>
<h3>&nbsp;&ldquo;Let a hundred flowers bloom.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>In a recent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/01/future-of-fun-flora-wearable/" target="_blank">interview&nbsp;on Wired</a>, <strong>Phillip Torrone</strong>, Adafruit&rsquo;s creative director explained :&ldquo;We have lots of ideas, but one of the things we learned from&nbsp;our involvement with <em>(Microsoft, ndlr)</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/" target="_blank">Open Kinect</a>,&nbsp;is that it&rsquo;s better to turn it over to the Adafruit&rsquo;s community, see what they imagine, and let them go. <strong>Ultimately users and other developers are going to be the ones who figure out what the platform will do</strong>.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one reason we named it &lsquo;Flora,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let a hundred flowers bloom!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>And you? How will you use it?</strong></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Sunglasses Frames Made From Whiskey Barrels ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><em>March 17<sup>th</sup>, &nbsp;it&rsquo;s St Patrick&rsquo;s Day!</em></h3>
<p>Today, thousands of people will wear green outfits and will celebrate Ireland and Irish with parades, maybe with a pint of beer or a shot of whiskey&hellip; but only one hundred of people will have the chance to show up with a pair of sunglasses with<strong> frames made from Whiskey barrels</strong>!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.shwoodshop.com/" target="_blank">Shwood</a></strong>, a Portland-based sunglasses company, is well known on using&nbsp;sustainably harvested wood&nbsp;to make their frames. This time, it has associated with the legendary<strong> Bushmills Irish Whiskey distillery</strong> and a Boston boutique, <a href="http://shop.bdgastore.com/">Bodega</a>,&nbsp;to produce a very St Patrick&rsquo;s day inspired sunglasses line.</p>
<p>Limited to 100 pairs (which have actually already sold out), the frames were made with white oak coming from old whiskey barrels as old as 100 years, who were shipped to Portland from the Bushmills distillery in Ireland.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Smart Window]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Samsung&nbsp;introduces its new&nbsp;smart window&nbsp;at the last Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geekologie.com/2011/07/surprise-samsungfunded-study-indicates-3.php">Samsung</a>&nbsp;spokeperson&nbsp;says "this conceptual smart window display could become an honest-to-goodness retail product in about two years".&nbsp;The smart window display has daytime and nighttime modes and its brightness is adjustable. If ambient light is not available, the night-time mode switches on a hidden BLU. When the BLU is off, the prototype then uses one tenth the power of a normal LCD screen.</p>
<h2><strong>46-inch, transparent, touchscreen LCD</strong></h2>
<p>The smart window display has a 1366&times;768 resolution, and when images and videos appear on screen, transparency is reduced to 5.8 percent. The entire display is 9 mm thick, weighs less than 10 pounds, uses HDMI and USB to interface with a computer.</p>
<h2><strong>The window can even turn into virtual blinds</strong></h2>
<p>Basically, the device is a "one-way window" as people on the other side can't see in with a&nbsp;full-pane&nbsp;electronic touchscreen display where info, roam the internet, movies can be displayed</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Facial Recognition Vending Machine ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>This Japanese conceptual Vending Machine was&nbsp;developed by <a href="http://www.sanden.com/" target="_blank">Sanden</a>, a large manufacturer of vending machines, in conjunction with <a href="http://www.okaya.com/oea/index.aspx" target="_blank">Okaya Electronics</a> and Intel. It&nbsp;uses Facial Recognition to make recommendations based on stereotypes.</p>
<h3>The machine Can Recognize Whether Customers are Male or Female, or Old or Young</h3>
<p>Customers can&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;see merchandises&nbsp;through&nbsp;the window as they can see HD text, pictures and animations on the display. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The machine&nbsp;features <span>a vertical</span>&nbsp;transparent 65" HD display and a&nbsp;facial recognition&nbsp;software,&nbsp;the Intel SandyBridge Core. It features AIM,&nbsp;<a href="http://intel.cognovision.com/intel-aim-suite" target="_blank">Audience Impression Metric</a>, and can do anonymous face recognition. In concrete terms, the machine can recognize whether customers are male or female, or old or young and&nbsp;can&nbsp;shows advertising content to match the customers demographic&nbsp;or make recommendations based on those characteristics.</p>
<h3>The Next-Generation&nbsp;Vending Machine&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In the demo, conceptors suggest that the vending machine could be used to purchase <strong>luxury items</strong>, such as cosmetics... and maybe <strong>jewelry or well sized clothes</strong>, pre-selected by the machine, based on your physical features.</p>
<p><span><span>"I think this machine could be used in lots of ways, depending on customers' imagination." Mayumi Moribayashi from Okaya Electronics says, &nbsp;"<strong>It has a great many possibilities, so we'd like to get ideas from everyone</strong>, rather than just using it as a regular vending machine."</span></span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[The Derville Shoes: High Tech and Handcraft Tradition.]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong><a href="http://www.derville-chaussures.fr/accueil.html" target="_blank">Derville</a>, a Parisian bootmaker, adapts handcraft's techniques, to make the custom built shoes device more accessible.&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The shop is almost hidden in a tiny street, near the Palais Royal in Paris, France and doesn&rsquo;t looks like any other boot maker workshop&hellip; the feeling here is a clever mix between modernity, Hight Tech and tradition.</p>
<h3><strong>A German 3D scan, a Finnish software and the French Know-How</strong></h3>
<p>Measurements are taken through a 3D scan : a digital camera rotates around your feet and takes more than 100 pictures to obtain&nbsp;<strong>14 key measurements</strong>.&nbsp;The process is really fast and more accurate than manual measurements : within two minutes the 3D image of your feet appears. Each foot is analyzed using four variables: length, width, thickness at the toes and instep.</p>
<p>And since&nbsp;sensitivity is as important as measurements and comfort is also a matter of feeling, a &ldquo;test shoes&rdquo; will identify whether a person likes adjusted shoes or rather prefers to fell a little off.</p>
<h3><strong>Become the co-designer of your next pair of shoes</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>Then you will just have to decide which style you want to go for between more than &nbsp;700 variations of models before choosing the patina that will mix colors to infinity. This handmade patina will turn your shoes to be unique.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your shoes will be handcraft in France with a know how tradition, and will be deliver within 6 to 8 weeks.</p>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[Borre Akkersdijk Knitting 3D Fabric Collection]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong><span>A&nbsp;young designer twisted&nbsp;a technique typically used in</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong><em>mattress production</em></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong><span>to create a&nbsp;knitting 3D fabric collection</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>The young designer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.byborre.com/" target="_blank">Borre Akkersdijk</a>&nbsp;who graduated from <strong>Design Academy Eindhoven</strong> in 2011, created a collection of 3D knit garments. He&nbsp;</span>worked with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.innofa.com/">Innofa</a>, a Dutch textile factory, producing multi-dimensional quilted fabrics for mattresses when he got the idea to <strong>hijack the process</strong> <strong>to</strong><strong>&nbsp;built a garment&nbsp;</strong><strong>collection.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span><strong><strong>A giant knitting machine&nbsp;</strong>produces tubes of fabric with seam allowances that are&nbsp;pattern components&nbsp;ready to be sewn</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>To produce the <strong>3D fabric collection</strong>, the clothes were built on a sort of<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong>giant knitting machine</strong>. The knitter produces tubes of fabric with seam allowances that are&nbsp;pattern components&nbsp;ready to be sewn. The<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong>ready to be sewn fabric pattern</strong><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>components are also&nbsp;padded&nbsp;as it is knitted with a "filler thread" that gives it its volume.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="http://digitaldesigntherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/textielmuseum-3d-knitting3.jpg" alt="A screenshot from Borre Akkersdijk's 3D Knitting video collaboration with TextielLab." /></span></p>
<h3><strong>A soulful collection of "stuffed" garments&nbsp;padded with a filler thread</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<p><span>Borre Akkersdijk 3D fabric collection result is a range of "puffed" garments, including several trousers, tunics and jackets,&nbsp;a cape and a&nbsp;parka. The fabric's patterns were inspired from a kilim rug, which had belonged to&nbsp;Borre Akkersdijk's&nbsp;beloved&nbsp;aunt, who recently died.</span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[How To : Make a Programmable LED Umbrella With Arduino Mini Pro]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong>A Whimsical and Magical&nbsp;Portable Programmable LED Matrix</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Chris Huebner&nbsp;</strong>had the desire to build a programmable LED matrix that is ultra-portable and had the crazy and brillant idea to do it using... an umbrella! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris had also the great idea to share his project and created an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/" target="_blank">"instructable"</a> to explain, step by step, how to reproduce this whimsical and magical umbrella.</p>
<h3><strong>A controllable, programmable LED show in the cosiness of your own umbrella</strong></h3>
<p>Using conductive thread and sewing an 8x8 matrix of LEDs into collapsable umbrella, then adding a MAX7219 LED Controller, a voltage converter and an Arduino mini pro, he got&nbsp;a jellyfish like twinkling blue light show that can fold up to go virtually anywhere.</p>
<h3><strong>Let's dance in the rain!</strong></h3>
<p>To undertake this project, you should have access to standard tools (including soldering iron and solder) and have experiencing working with the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> hardware. Note that the Arduino is easy to setup and a program including several different animations of the LEDs is included in this 'instructible'... it's now time to party!</p>
<p><span>Get the complete "instructable" tutorial&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Programmable-LED-Umbrella/" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA["Real" Back to the Future Sneakers]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong>A LED-Electroluminescent Geek's Dream Pair of Shoes</strong></h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Hatfield" target="_blank">Tinker Hatfield</a></strong>,&nbsp;the famous designer of many of&nbsp;<a href="http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/?cp=USNS_KW_0611081618&amp;l=shop,home" target="_blank">Nike</a>'s most popular and innovative shoes (including the iconic&nbsp;Air Jordan) presents the&nbsp;<a href="http://nikemag.ebay.com/" target="_blank">2011 Nike MAG Sneakers</a>&nbsp;that was a limited edition design based off a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/" target="_blank">Back to the Future</a>&nbsp;movie. Together with the&nbsp;designer <strong>Tiffany Beers</strong>, he explains in this video,&nbsp;the 23 year creative process and how they made these&nbsp;LED-electroluminescent&nbsp;dream shoes.</p>
<h3><strong>The 1500 Limited-Edition Pair of Shoes Price Was Originally Set at 99 Cents</strong></h3>
<p>The 1500 limited-edition pair of shoes were sold on&nbsp;<a href="http://nikemag.ebay.com/">Nikemag.ebay.com</a>&nbsp;and the price&nbsp;was originally set at 99 cents.&nbsp;The&nbsp;shoes prices climbed above $3,500 in a wink on the first night of bidding, with some models topping $4,000.</p>
<p>The whole sale profits went to the<strong>&nbsp;Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research</strong>, the foundation set up by the actor who played the&nbsp;<strong>Marty McFly</strong>&nbsp;character in the original<em>&nbsp;Back to the&nbsp;</em><em>Future</em>&nbsp;trilogy.</p>
<h3><strong>"Does This Power-Lace?"</strong></h3>
<p>Note that unlike <a href="http://youtu.be/28Wa5L-fkkM" target="_blank">the ones featured in the <em>Back to the Future Part II</em>&nbsp;movie</a>, those shoes are not self-tying&nbsp;even though Nike&nbsp;patented&nbsp;the <strong>self-lacing design</strong>... but yes, a<span>s any child of the 80's can remembers, <strong>the "Nike Air Mag" was a futuristic prop that was sold in 2015</strong>.</span></p>
<p>As a jest, in a fun&nbsp;<a href="http://youtu.be/pxQQV-XukRc" target="_blank">promotional video</a>, Christopher Lloyd (reprising his role as Doctor Emmitt Brown) asks :&nbsp;- "Does this power-lace?" and&nbsp;the Nike employee responds :</p>
<p>- "Not until 2015"!</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Google's new augmented-reality Glasses could be available to the public by the end of 2012</strong></h3>
<p>Several anonymous Google employees are reporting that <strong>"Google glasses"</strong> could be available to the public by the end of this year. For months, rumor as it that an Android-powered device that can provide a heads-up display to the wearer and connect over wireless data services was developed by Google.<strong> The glasses should provide real time information</strong> on a user's location thanks to a GPS and motion sensors.</p>
<h3><strong>Vision of the Future : Users will be able to walk around with &ldquo;information popping up into display"</strong></h3>
<p>The Google goggles are said to<strong>&nbsp;look alike a regular pair of eyeglasses</strong>&nbsp;with few buttons on the arms of the glasses with a design slightly similar to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakley_THUMP" target="_blank">Oakley Thumps</a>&nbsp;(pictured above). And<strong>&nbsp;like a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/" target="_blank">Terminator</a></strong>, users will be able to walk around with &ldquo;information popping up and into display". &nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>With a WiFi or a 3G/4G connection, the goggles will tap into Google's cloud and relay information to the user on their surrounding condition, like locations or friends nearby and objects that they look at</strong></h3>
<p>The Google glasses have apparently been<strong> in production for a long time</strong> and the same anonymous employees even told the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;that the goggles are expected to be <strong>priced like current Smartphones</strong>. For that matter, the glasses could use a phone&rsquo;s Internet connection, through Wi-Fi or a low power Bluetooth 4.0. and <strong>should also work as a common smartphone</strong>, allowing users to make calls and use a wide range of apps. The glasses should feature a low-resolution built-in flash camera on the front to take pictures and self evidently for gathering information to relay to a small screen built into one side of the lenses. A non transparent screen should be located to the side of the frame, to give an <strong>augmented reality feel</strong> without interfering too much with the user&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>Not much else is known about the glasses features. but,<em> based on what we think we know</em>, <strong>what would you like to see implemented in the goggles</strong>?</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Aurora - The Laser Watch With No Face ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong>A Watch That Tells Time With Lasers&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<p>Aurora is a watch without any apparent dial. Actually it has a completely transparent face with no signs of the hour or minutes hand but a&nbsp;<strong>Touch Activated Laser Hands</strong>. This innovative watch has been created by the designer <strong>Jihun Yeom</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>A Technologic Challenge and a Beautiful Clean Design</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<p>Yeom decided to put<strong> laser lights in the watch instead of the classical beams</strong>. The beams appear only when tapping the bevel edge around the watch ring, the red one indicating minutes and blue indicating hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Touch activated lasers</strong> can be seen by daylight depending on the power. But for now, it's almost impossible to see a laser beam unless it is hitting you in the eyes or if they&nbsp;angle the laser so it could hit the wrist.&nbsp;The other way to see laser beams depends of the immediate air quality. It will be more easy to see the beams if there is mist or dust in the air to scatter the light but it seems a fantasy solution, unless if you are ready to breath some steam each time you have tell the time...&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Still a Concept</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<p>The sad reality is that this&nbsp;<em>'Jedi' style</em>&nbsp;watch is <strong>only a concept for now.</strong> And&nbsp;yes, "<em>concept&nbsp;means concept".&nbsp;</em>The designer may&nbsp;will have to settle technological barriers or conform to them before he will be able to produce a proper product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too bad&nbsp;because&nbsp;I can't wait to show off with this nice essential Geek accessory!</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Introducing the real Google&nbsp;&ldquo;Project Glass&rdquo;!</strong></h3>
<p>Finally the company&nbsp;Google&nbsp;gave us a brief sight of their future augmented reality device with the unveiling of&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/111626127367496192147/posts" target="_blank">&ldquo;Project Glass&rdquo;</a></p>
<h3><strong>Google employees are now allowed to "real world test" the futuristic pair of glasses out in public. </strong></h3>
<p><span><span>As expected the goggles will have the ability to <strong>superimpose virtual data onto real-world environments</strong>. A video produced by Google already reveals without surprise how the company&nbsp;</span></span>integrated&nbsp;its other services such as&nbsp;<a href="http://maps.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/" target="_blank">Google Talk</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/up/accounts/upgrade/?continue=https://plus.google.com/?utm_source%3Dbk%26utm_medium%3Dha%26utm_campaign%3Dplusgeneralb2c%26gpsrc%3Dawse1%26utm_term%3D%252Bgoogle%252B&amp;gpsrc=awse1" target="_blank">Google+</a>&nbsp;in the device.&nbsp;This <em>first-person perspective</em>&nbsp;video&nbsp;of Project Glass&rsquo;s just gives a glimpse of this new gear potential and allowed us to dream about<span>&nbsp;the range of possible utilisations...&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;voice commands using to navigate in the the streets, check into locations,&nbsp;communicate with friends or video chat, shoot and upload photos...&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>This project could revolutionize the way the mobile industry is developing</strong></h3>
<p>&ldquo;We think technology should work for you&mdash;to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Google researchers say on their project page. &ldquo;A group of us started Project Glass to build this kind of technology, one that helps you explore and share your world, putting you back in the moment.&rdquo;</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Yet another month-long fashion relay came to an end identifying the new, well forgotten or reinterpreted trends of the next fall-winter season.</strong></h3>
<p>To one of the highlights of the <strong>pr&ecirc;t-&agrave;-porter week in Paris</strong> we should attribute an anniversary collection of <strong>Alber Elbaz for Lanvin</strong>, which presentation was crowned by the festive song of couture.</p>
<p>No less interesting show was presented by<strong> Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton</strong>: on the eve of the exhibition devoted to twenty-year collaboration with the brand, <strong>the designer has created a unique by its texture richness and color palette collection, one of best in the history of the fashion house</strong>. And of course it is impossible to ignore the grand defile of <strong>Chanel</strong>, exclusively carried out under the glass ceilings of the "Grand Palais". This time Carl took us in a fashion trip to the country of rock crystals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The creative duo of<strong>&nbsp;Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pier Paolo Piccioli</strong>, working already for years under the&nbsp;<strong>Valentino</strong>&nbsp;brand, presented a perfect in its completeness collection. The quintessence of femininity, the return to which was proclaimed by almost all the leading fashion houses a few seasons ago, Valentino organically combined with upcoming winter fashion trends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7096/7173668796_9887e63eab_m.jpg" alt="val1" /><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5035/7173669062_bd0144e67a_m.jpg" alt="val2" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7092/7173668552_d9b1a675e4_m.jpg" alt="Val3" /></p>
<h3><strong>The new season is marked by a widespread return of the noble black. Monochrome (like YSL) or the classic&nbsp;combination of black and white variations...</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7100/7173673852_421c832924_m.jpg" alt="BB" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7092/7173674178_d8e9b1bba4_m.jpg" alt="lanvin" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7097/7173674446_374fb60415_m.jpg" alt="Valentino" /><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5113/7173673626_a9fc20f09d_m.jpg" alt="YSL" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;Along with a scarlet-red is in vogue again.</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8149/7173677564_c0810a4f83_m.jpg" alt="Alexander McQueen" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7242/7173678072_390a7ce5fe_m.jpg" alt="Chlo&eacute;" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7104/7173677786_ddea5b2acd_m.jpg" alt="Gyvenchy" /><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8014/7173678294_5e7405b703_m.jpg" alt="JG" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7214/7173677360_a9e2e4482b_m.jpg" alt="JPG" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Next season, the designers&rsquo; favorite blue, in its deeper, Nordic variations, also remains relevant</strong></h3>
<p>However it&rsquo;s not necessarily to limit yourself to the black-white-red tricolor to reign in the fashion Olympus next season: the designers&rsquo; favorite blue, in its deeper, Nordic variations, also remains relevant. Stella McCartney, whose collection puts an emphasis on this color, offers surprisingly feminine monochrome midi-and mini-dresses or structural dark blue coats with an asymmetrical zipper combined with white trousers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7097/7173682234_ca6721dc5d_m.jpg" alt="Chanel" /><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5460/7173682470_483f4fe1c9_m.jpg" alt="Miu Miu" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7242/7173682686_e202ccdca2_m.jpg" alt="Paco Rabanne" /><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5467/7173681876_f54c265b7f_m.jpg" alt="Stella McCartney" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Gray, as we know, is the color of kings. And its shades are back in fashion</strong></h3>
<p>From the &ldquo;starlit silver&rdquo; in a futuristic <strong>Paco Rabanne</strong> collection, implemented by the genius of India Manish Aurora, to the "wet asphalt" of loose woolen <strong>Paul &amp; Joe</strong> trousers and to the "mole" in perfectly tailored bourgeois suits and fur coats of <strong>Elie Saab.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8154/7173684744_f13e375862_m.jpg" alt="Elie Saab" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7096/7173684484_e93911b589_m.jpg" alt="Paco Rabanne" /><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8153/7173684978_153e0178bd_m.jpg" alt="Paul&amp;Joe" /><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8143/7173684202_321c2af383_m.jpg" alt="Rick Owens" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Hourglass silhouettes, born in the fifties&nbsp;continue to hold the top position in Fashion</strong></h3>
<p>The &ldquo;New Look&rdquo; is an hourglass silhouette, born in the fifties and designed to emphasize the feminine form. Triumphantly returned to the podium a few seasons ago, it continues to hold the top position in fashion. Especially gorgeous this silhouette is in a dress-coat of Alexis Mabille, it is perfect in Dior collection and young - in Lanvin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7230/7173706668_2f19e84250_m.jpg" alt="Alexis Mabille" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7091/7173706924_7e30079aa8_m.jpg" alt="dior" /><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8163/7173706404_3b54f85752_m.jpg" alt="lanvin" /></p>
<h3><strong>Indeed, the Lanvin collection is worth a special attention. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Extremely bright, stylish and unforgettable</strong> - it became the apogee of a decade of <strong>Alber Elbaz</strong>&rsquo;s creative work for the fashion house. The heroine of Lanvin is strong and self-confident, whose wardrobe is a reflection of her character.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5470/7173708680_01032fe8f5_m.jpg" alt="lanv1" /><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8160/7173708990_75472b4ed8_m.jpg" alt="lanv2" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7218/7173709274_dd9e0537d6_m.jpg" alt="Lanv3" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7100/7173708312_13c64b9ac0_m.jpg" alt="lanv4" /></p>
<h3><strong>One of the interesting trends that has passed from the previous season is large laces...</strong></h3>
<p>...creating the effect of perforated leather, invented by <strong>Marc Jacobs</strong> for the summer Louis Vuitton collection. Especially well they turned out in <strong>Valentino</strong> &ndash; perhaps one of the most famous fashion houses in lacing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8164/7173726336_b914e68585_m.jpg" alt="13" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7226/7173726568_45f7c56670_m.jpg" alt="Alexander McQueen" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7080/7173726108_cf91d329cb_m.jpg" alt="VALENTINO" /></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Paris Fashion Week Review Part 3 - Accessories - Season Fall-Winter 2012/2013 By Tatiana Stolyarova ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Accessories</strong></h3>
<p>Finally! Designers in the upcoming season will save us from a painful accessories matching process: <strong>the &ldquo;decorations&rdquo; were everywhere migrated on the dress, becoming an integral part of i</strong>t. Look out for elegant inlays in <strong>Miu Miu, Chanel, Lanvin, Valentino, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, McQueen,</strong> and even in the normally restrained <strong>Chlo&eacute;</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long <strong>evening leather gloves</strong> were a sign of aristocracy at all times and were coupled with impeccable posture and impregnable gaze.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7082/7173730458_1f074f830e_m.jpg" alt="Nina Ricci" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5336/7173731540_4c0fde9729_m.jpg" alt="lanvin" /></p>
<p>Nina Ricci &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lanvin</p>
<p>Blue-blooded fashionable women are suggested to carry them in a men-demoralizing combination with bare shoulders or in a "hunter" version trimmed with fur. And not necessary black!</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7101/7173730922_ea0a115509_m.jpg" alt="Givenchy" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7223/7173731246_1ff8ebba29_m.jpg" alt="chanel" /></p>
<p>Givenchy &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chanel</p>
<p>In the neck scarves, remaining a timeless fashion accessory, the most important is how they are tied. You can spot a win-win style at <strong>C&eacute;line</strong> (for the modest) and <strong>Givenchy</strong> (for the temptress).&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7097/7173732850_c6c966371e_m.jpg" alt="Givenchy" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8011/7173733022_2b771258ea_m.jpg" alt="Celine" /></p>
<p>Givenchy &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Celine</p>
<h3><strong>And finally, her majesty the Hat!</strong></h3>
<p>The power of which is often underestimated by the modern society. Meanwhile one deft wave of pheasant feathers can turn the head of the most desperate bachelor.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8024/7173735278_b7580a3c07_m.jpg" alt="LV" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5337/7173734970_0eb124e164_m.jpg" alt="JG" /></p>
<p>Louis Vuitton &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;John Galliano</p>
<p>In bulky ones from&nbsp;<strong>Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton</strong>, pulled down over the forehead, you can hide a dozen rabbits. In Bill Gayten&rsquo;s collection for&nbsp;<strong>John Galliano</strong>, in a strict accordance with the spirit of the brand, <strong>hats are invited to be worn in combination with a lavaliere bow and&hellip; stockings on garters</strong>. The key here is to correctly cock your hat. And if the political biases of the founder of this brand may rise doubts, the perfection of his taste - never.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Paris Fashion Week Review Part 2 - Coats and Leather - Season Fall-Winter 2012/2013 by Tatiana Stolyarova]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3>A coat : the traditional fall-winter wardrobe item</h3>
<p>Designers suggest wearing next winter with structural wide shoulders as, for example, in the <strong>Stella McCartney</strong> collection or perfectly-fitted and embroidered like <strong>Valentino</strong> or leather and straight, like <strong>YSL</strong>. And <strong>a belt, the important accessory, emphasizing the waist.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h3><strong>As for cashmere coat with fur collar &ndash; it can relieve its owner from the need to choose a dress as such.&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Nina Ricci &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;JPG</p>
<h3><strong>To show some originality&nbsp;a coat can be replaced by a fashionable cape</strong></h3>
<p>An &ldquo;evening&rdquo; version as in the <strong>Elie Saab</strong> collection, or more casual, as in <strong>Chlo&eacute;</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7215/7173718050_3868fde909_m.jpg" alt="Chlo&eacute;" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7220/7173718284_b998ec2653_m.jpg" alt="Elie Saab" /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7104/7173717746_dcc00a87f8_m.jpg" alt="Valentino" /></p>

<h3><strong>With the advent of cold weather we are awaiting a triumphant return of the leather to the wardrobe</strong>.</h3>
<p>A unique by its originality approach to this material you will find in collections of the unrivaled leather master <strong>Haider Ackermann</strong> and Belgian <strong>Anne Demeulemeester</strong> from the famous "Antwerp Six&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[The Book Of the Week - "Textile Futures: Fashion, Design and Technology" by Bradley Quinn]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>"The Book of the Week"</strong></h2>
<p><em>Each week, FashionLab's editors pick<strong>&nbsp;a must have book</strong>&nbsp;for your bookshelf.</em></p>
<h3><strong>"Textile Futures: Fashion, Design and Technology"&nbsp;by Bradley Quinn,&nbsp;is a must read book for anyone interested in exokeletons, robotics, textiles and new technologies</strong></h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bradley-Quinn/e/B001IOFBHE/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0" target="_blank">Bradley Quinn</a>&nbsp;</strong>is a British writer, journalist and independent scholar with expertise in fashion, textiles and design. His&nbsp;book&nbsp;<strong>"Textile Futures: Fashion, Design and Technology",&nbsp;</strong>is not only about new textile materials, but also about textile innovations the future may hold.</p>
<h3><strong>Textile Futures expand our point of view of &ldquo;what a textile is&rdquo; and &ldquo;what functions it can have&rdquo; or what the next generation of textiles could achieve</strong></h3>
<p>According to Quinn &ldquo;<strong>textiles are transcending their traditional functions</strong>,&hellip; morphing into uniquely tactile interfaces through which broader sensory stimulus can be perceived&hellip;.Because fibres, fabrics and textile techniques are becoming seamlessly integrated with technology, textiles represent an interconnected collective that links many disciplines.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><strong>The information in&nbsp;<em>Textile Futures</em>&nbsp;is totally fascinating, as it shows the potential that textiles have to transform our world</strong></h3>
<p>Quinn's enthralling text is supported by good illustrations and supplemented with short designers and researchers interviews. This book, produced like a<strong>&nbsp;scientific publication</strong>, (with detailed notes, bibliography, index in the appendix etc.), was written with a punchy journalistic tone, making the whole work&nbsp;<strong>accessible and easy to read.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This work&nbsp;should be required reading for any designers and design students!</p>

<h3><strong>Anne had the fashion on her mind from her early years</strong></h3>
<p>At<strong> 7 years old</strong>, she realized she had<strong> a fascination for the fashion world and design</strong>. Later, she decided to turn her passion into her professional activity.&nbsp;She graduated from the <strong>Lausanne fashion school</strong> <strong>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.ecoledecouture.ch/" target="_blank">Ecole de Couture de Lausanne</a>&rdquo;</strong>. Four years later, armed with more artistic and technical maturity, she decided to complete her formation and went to Italy to attend the Milan <strong><a href="http://www.istitutomarangoni.com/en/landing/short-courses.php?gclid=CKH_-NOFz68CFUbe4AodLERaFQ" target="_blank">Instituto Marangoni</a></strong> in the <strong>Fashion Design section</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>Now she is back to Switzerland, the passion is still there as well as Talent</strong></h3>
<p>The young woman says &ldquo;&lt;she is&gt; very happy for winning the first Talons Aiguilles contest price and sure it will helps a lot for the next steps&rdquo;. Anne would like now to step out by <strong>creating her own label</strong>.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Molded 3-Dimensional Garments]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3 class="paragraphstyle"><strong>A collection inspired by plastic molding process</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphstyle"><strong>Jungeun Lee</strong> was born in South Korea. She was a<strong> <a href="http://www.rca.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Royal College of Arts</a></strong> Student finishing her MA degree when she rethought about the <em>fundamental process</em> of producing a garment. Inspired by plastic molding process she wanted to apply this technique into <strong>creating 3-dimensional garments</strong>. Experimenting and researching <strong>unconventional methods </strong>she has created a fashion collection made from covering synthetic strand around a wooden form.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="paragraphstyle"><strong>Nuue, the collection&rsquo;s name, means cocoon in Korean</strong></h3>
<p>After being coiled, the fiber undergoes through a<strong> heating process</strong> with pressure and is molded into a 3-dimensional garment completed with only unitary fibre and heat! The results are incredible <strong>aerial flexible and sculptural</strong> garments. Originally called Wrapped Garment project, the collection name became <strong>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.studiokoya.com/Home/Nuue.html" target="_blank">Nuue</a>&rdquo;</strong> after a word that means cocoon in Korean.</p>
<h3 class="paragraphstyle"><strong>A groundbreaking sustainable project</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphstyle"><span>The conceptual products that have been created through this <strong>innovative technique</strong> display the <strong>sustainability potential</strong> of this idea. </span><span>This process doesn&rsquo;t require fabric and can use recycled synthetic fiber. Therefore, all the traditional garment production steps such as making/cutting pattern, and sawing are pointless. Best of all, there is <strong>no leftover or wastage of material</strong> in the building process</span></p>
<p class="paragraphstyle"><span><strong>Jungeun Lee</strong> now works on solo project or with accomplice <strong>Shota Aoyagi</strong> on various projects in their design studio, <strong><a href="http://www.studiokoya.com/Home/News.html" target="_blank">Koya</a></strong>.</span><span> She is</span><span> currently working on the next collection of Nuue.</span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Eco-Friendly Lotus Flower Fabric]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><span><strong><span>100% Natural Lotus Flower Fiber made by hand in Cambodia</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>Awen Delaval</strong> a French fabric designer created the<strong> <a href="http://www.lotus-flower-fabric.com/" target="_blank">Lotus Center in Battambang</a></strong>. In this unique experimentation studio for research on lotus fibers and sub products he is helping women in Cambodia to support themselves by turning lotus flower into thread that can be weave.</p>
<h3><strong>The Lotus fabric looks like a blend of linen and raw silk</strong></h3>
<p><span>The Lotus fabric has<strong> historically been used to make robes for high-ranking Buddhist monks</strong>. The material is made from a fibrous substance that is <strong>pulled by hand</strong> out of lotus flower stems. Once spun into threads the fibers are hand-woven into a fabric that looks like a cross between raw silk and linen.</span></p>
<h3><strong>An alternative fabric to non eco-friendly fibers</strong></h3>
<p><span>This elegant </span><strong>soft to the touch</strong><span> fabric is also <strong>naturally 100% waterproof</strong>. It&rsquo;s not a surprise it starts to make its way onto the fashion market, providing an alternative to non eco-friendly fibers and synthetics water repellent. But since it</span><span> takes about 32,000 lotus stems to make just 1.09 yards of fabric, the production is still confidential and</span><span class="apple-converted-space"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>is reserved for a&nbsp;</span><span><strong>luxury use</strong>.</span></p>

    <body><![CDATA[<p><strong>by Roxane Penne</strong></p>
<h3><strong>WireWax offers you a way to make trending "taggable" video for your fashion campaign or music video.</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.wirewax.com/" target="_blank">WireWax</a>, the successful Londoner company who develops<strong> the world's</strong> <strong>first&nbsp;taggable&nbsp;video tool</strong> has already worked with the Canada&rsquo;s largest online fashion retailer, <a href="http://www.ssense.com/" target="_blank">SSENSE</a>, but also Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Rip Curl or Oki-Ni. Its tool <strong>makes your video &ldquo;shoppable&rdquo;</strong> and buzzes on social network. Thanks to this new application, when you watch videos and wonder, &ldquo;where did he get that jacket?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;where can I buy that jacket?&rdquo;, you can now buy this look right away.</p>
<h3><strong>My shop experience: I tried it and I was on the brink of wearing the same dress as Iggy Azalea</strong></h3>
<p>I was watching the music video of <strong>FKI, Iggy Azalea and Diplo</strong> on <a href="http://www.ssense.com/video/iggy-azalea-diplo-fki-i-think-she-ready/" target="_blank">SSENSE</a> and clicked on Iggy Azalea<strong> &ldquo;SHOP THIS LOOK&rdquo;</strong>. Then appeared on my screen all the things she wore.<strong> I opted for the dress</strong>. It was an HELMUT LANG dress, costing $620. In less than 2 minutes, I selected my size and... almost bought it online! No more frustration,<strong> have what you see in one single click</strong>; except the latest and recurrent obstacle is to have enough money on your bank account!&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Jonathan Riss Honored as Apparel Magazine Top Innovator for Pushing Design Boundaries with FashionLab]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3>3D Experience in Fashion</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&nbsp;have announced this Monday that Jonathan Riss, artistic director of the JAY AHR House, one of our ambassador, has been selected as a 2012 Top Innovator by Apparel Magazine.</p>
<p>By working with our team of engineers, Jonathan Riss is creating luxurious embroidery and jewelry that is intricate and innovative and created in a way that is more environmentally conscious than traditional methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a id="yui_3_5_0_3_1336653311888_902" class="rapidnofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79884939@N02/7170410088/in/photostream" data-track="photo-click"><img id="yui_3_5_0_3_1336653311888_901" class="pc_img" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7093/7170410088_4830433433_m.jpg" alt="JAY AHR Jewelry" width="240" height="134" border="0" data-thumbdata="" /></a></p>
<h3>Innovative Design</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using our 3D Design software, our ambassador is experimenting with new materials, such as colored glass or satin finish, as well as new color mixtures for the JAY AHR High Fine Jewelry collection. By crafting his jewelry and embroidery digitally in a 3D life-like environment, he is able to collaborate with his global team and test the feasibility and functionality of his designs using virtual prototypes.</p>
<p><a id="yui_3_5_0_3_1336653311888_907" class="rapidnofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79884939@N02/7170410104/in/photostream" data-track="photo-click"><img id="yui_3_5_0_3_1336653311888_938" class="pc_img" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5449/7170426222_c71190ed78_m.jpg" alt="JAY AHR Embroideries" width="240" height="135" border="0" data-thumbdata="" /></a></p>
<p>This process not only reduces the amount of waste generated in the production of physical prototypes, but cuts down on the cost of multiple iterations. Rendering his designs as 3D virtual prototypes enables Riss to reduce the time it takes to finalize his designs and get them to the manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a id="yui_3_5_0_3_1336653311888_907" class="rapidnofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79884939@N02/7170410104/in/photostream" data-track="photo-click"><img id="yui_3_5_0_3_1336653311888_906" class="pc_img" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5156/7170410104_3ac4fc6225_m.jpg" alt="JAY AHR Jewelry" width="240" height="134" border="0" data-thumbdata="" /></a></p>
<h3>FashionLab and JAY AHR partnership</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Using 3D software has revolutionized my approach to design,&rdquo; said Riss. &ldquo;By designing virtually, I&rsquo;m able to knock down the barriers of cost and practicality that typically constrain the creative process. The benefits of integrating technology and fashion &ndash; reducing limitations, cutting costs and saving time &ndash; are far-reaching, and I&rsquo;m honored that Apparel has recognized my work with FashionLab to make that union a reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Apparel Magazine Top Innovator award</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Apparel Magazine Top Innovator award, now in its fifth year, recognizes 35 innovative apparel retailers, brands, manufacturers and strategic business partners for their exceptional IT-related implementations, product launches and other outstanding business strategies that are changing the industry. Jonathan Riss will be featured alongside other top apparel companies in the May &ldquo;Innovator&rdquo; special issue of Apparel Magazine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>FashionLab</h3>

    <title><![CDATA[Transparent, Lightweight, Flexible Conductor Could Revolutionize Wearable Electronics Industry]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3 id="headline" class="story">The most transparent, lightweight, flexible conductor could revolutionize the creation of wearable electronic devices</h3>
<p>The most transparent, lightweight and flexible material ever for conducting electricity just had been invented by a researchers team from the <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Exeter</a>. The material, a layer of ferric chloride molecules between two sheets of graphene&nbsp;is called&nbsp;<strong>GraphExeter</strong>&nbsp;and could revolutionize the creation of wearable electronic devices, such as clothing containing computers, phones and MP3 players.</p>
<h3 id="headline" class="story">GraphExter is a material with an incredible potential</h3>
<p><span>Adapted from graphene, the thinnest material able to conduct electricity, GraphExeter is even more flexible than indium tin oxide (ITO), the main conductive material that is currently used in the electronic industry. And the timing couldn&rsquo;t be better: ITO is a finite and increasingly expensive resource expected to run out in less than five years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;GraphExeter could revolutionise the electronics industry. It outperforms any other carbon-based transparent conductor used in electronics and could be used for a range of applications, from solar panels to &lsquo;smart&rsquo; teeshirts. We are very excited about the potential of this material and look forward to seeing where it can take the electronics industry in the future.&rdquo; <strong><a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/staff/mfc204" target="_blank">Dr Monica Craciun</a></strong>,&nbsp;Lead researcher, University of Exeter engineer says.</p>
<h3>Soon a sparayable version&nbsp;<span>which could be applied straight onto any support</span></h3>
<p>The team from the University of Exeter&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/research/graphene/">Centre for Graphene Science</a>&nbsp;which invented and produced the material&nbsp;is now developing a spray-on version of GraphExeter. The sparayable version then could be directly applied onto fabrics, mirrors and windows.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[A Flexible Textile Made Out of Wood Chips!]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong>A young German designer created "Wooden Textile", a new <em>fabric,</em> using wood tiles</strong></h3>
<p><strong>"Wooden Textiles"</strong> is an unexpected material created by the young German designer&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.elisastrozyk.de/" target="_blank">Elisa Strozyk</a></strong>. &nbsp;This completely new material is offering an <strong>out of the common</strong> <strong>tactile experience</strong>.&nbsp;We are obviously used to experience wood as a hard material. We use to envision wood as furniture but we usually don't have the idea to project a wooden surface which can be &lsquo;modulated&rsquo; and manipulated by touch.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know how wood is supposed to feel when you touch a tabletop or a shelf, but the concept of wrapping it around your body is a new experience,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.elisastrozyk.de/bilder/woodtex/textiles/woodentextile12.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h3><strong>Stozyk's inspiration came from a photo of a water-warped parquet floor</strong></h3>
<p>According to the website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dwell.com/articles/elisa-strozyk-new-guard.html" target="_blank">Dwell</a>, Elisa Strozyk randomly came across a photo of a water-warped parquet floor during her years at school and thought: &nbsp;&ldquo;My God, the wood came back to life and is frozen in motion.&rdquo; Wondering how she could recreate the effect she began to cut chips of wood in geometric shapes and attached them to a textile base. Her wooden textiles was born and one year later, she won the prestigious 2010 German Design Award for Newcomers with her project.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.elisastrozyk.de/bilder/woodtex/carpet/boewer_wooca_sherwood_310_03.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h3>A material that is half wood, half textile</h3>
<p>Of course, there is <strong><a href="%20http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscose" target="_blank">viscose</a></strong>, a fiber created by the French scientist&nbsp;<a title="Hilaire de Chardonnet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilaire_de_Chardonnet">Hilaire de Chardonnet</a> in the 19<sup>th</sup> century made of wood <a title="Dissolving pulp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolving_pulp">pulp</a>&nbsp;that is dissolved in&nbsp;<a title="Caustic soda" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caustic_soda">caustic soda</a>. <br /> But "Wooden Textiles" is a material that is <strong>half wood-half textile</strong>. Between hard and soft<strong> it challenges what we can expect from a material or category</strong>. "It looks and smells familiar but feels strange, as it is able to move and form in unexpected ways." Strozyk says.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.elisastrozyk.de/bilder/woodtex/textiles/woodentextile2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h3><strong>A simple, ingenious process</strong></h3>
<p>The process to transform wood into a flexible wooden surface is its <strong>deconstruction into small thin chips</strong>. The geometrics wooden parts are then attached to a textile base. The result looks alike <strong>3-D modeling software mock-up</strong> or more poetically, origami.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.elisastrozyk.de/bilder/woodtex/textiles/woodentextile7.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h3><strong>Applications are almost endless, especially in the home decoration area</strong></h3>
<p>According to the geometry and size of the chips <strong>each design shows a different behavior</strong> regarding flexibility and mobility, and the wooden textile could be used for example as rugs, curtains, plaids, shades or upholstery.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.elisastrozyk.de/bilder/woodtex/furniture2/sewing-box2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h3><strong>An innovative material, that will never go out of fashion</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike other fabrics, <strong>as the pieces made of wooden textile get older, they gain in beauty</strong>. Strozyk concluded saying &ldquo;I love how wood ages without losing its beauty. Somehow it just grows old in a nice way.&rdquo;</p>

    <title><![CDATA["Un Peu De Terre Sur La Peau" An Exhibition of Contemporary Jewels Made of Porcelain - by Olivier Schoutteten]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p><strong><strong>By&nbsp;<span>Olivier SCHOUTTETEN</span></strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong><strong>The Fondation Bernardaud presents an exhibition about an art that is not yet well recognized in France: contemporary jewelry.</strong></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to share with you this article about Bernardaud. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The French brand, well known for its Limoges' porcelains, is holding this exhibit named "Un peu de terre sur la peau" (a bit of clay on the skin)&nbsp;in Paris - Mus&eacute;e des Arts D&eacute;coratifs (same building as Louvre Museum)</p>
<p><img src="http://www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/local/cache-vignettes/L200xH277/Wu_-Shu-lin-1-247c1-0a9d6.jpg" alt="JPEG - 185.4 ko" /></p>
<p><em><span><strong><span>Shu-Lin Wu</span>, </strong>earring&nbsp;Girandole-Mokume # 2, 2010 &ndash; Porcelaine, silver &nbsp;-</span></em><span>&copy; photo&nbsp;: Hsiao-Yin Chao</span></p>
<h3><strong><strong>Un peu de terre sur la peau - A bit of clay on the skin&nbsp;</strong></strong></h3>
<p>The exhibition features&nbsp;140 compelling ceramic creations, from 18 international artists.&nbsp;<span>Some of the&nbsp;exhibit's&nbsp;pieces present a modernized and personal vision&nbsp;of their <em>generally associated with jewelry </em>creators' traditions,&nbsp;while others totally reinvent their concepts, and symbols.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="http://www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/local/cache-vignettes/L200xH271/Peter-Hoogeboom_-copyright--ab099-5acb4.jpg" alt="JPEG - 265.7 ko" /></span></p>
<p><span><span><em><strong><span>Peter Hoogeboom</span>,</strong>&nbsp;necklace Spanish Collar, 1995 &ndash; Porcelain, silver -</em></span><span>&copy; photo&nbsp;: Henni van Beek</span></span></p>
<h3><strong>Here is summary of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bernardaud.fr/index.php?id=fr18&amp;article=_efbfde529ae764cc3857a284dee00d5c" target="_blank">French only related&nbsp;article</a>, in the Bernardaud's website.</strong></h3>
<p>&ldquo;If traditional jewels are mainly based on precious stones and precious metals,</p>
<p>contemporary jewels are reaching to art, design and craftsmanship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exhibit displays 140 works made of ceramics, by 18 artists from various countries.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><strong>Contemporary jewelery has become a field of innovative experimentation&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>It is quite interesting to see how porcelain can be used in such new fields,&nbsp;and how artists can interpret this new material in so many different ways.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[ModeCloth: How the Online Retailer Get Customers to Design Their Own Garments]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Last November, ModCloth, an online retailer based in San Francisco, held a contest called "Make the Cut".</strong></h3>
<p>Usually, the company <a href="http://www.modcloth.com/" target="_blank">ModCloth</a> created by a married couple, Susan and Eric Koger, offers clothing and accessories from 600 independent designers. But last winter and for two weeks, <strong>Customers were invited to submit clothing sketches</strong>, with the hope to have their creations produced and sold on the retailer website.</p>
<h3><strong>1,900 submissions,&nbsp;100 pre-selected sketches, 7 winners&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The contest was a success. "We were swimming in<strong> a veritable sea of darling designs</strong>&rdquo; Susan Gregg Koger said after receiving more than 1,900 submissions. Susan Gregg Koger selected her favourite 100 sketches and let customers vote for their favorites on ModCloth's Facebook fan page. The event <strong>"Make the Cut"</strong> brought a crazy amount of hits and more than 10,000 votes and 1,000 comments.</p>

<h3>The&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/JyB9h8" target="_blank">twelve garments</a>&nbsp;that the internautes helped design and vote for are now available for purchase</h3>
<p>Each winner received a $500 prize per item produced, and their names appear on the clothes labels. Depending of the sales,&nbsp;<strong>future contests might include a &ldquo;revenue sharing&rdquo; program</strong>, in which winner designers could receive shares of &nbsp;the&nbsp;profits&nbsp;generated by&nbsp;their&nbsp;designs. Since the <a href="http://www.modcloth.com/store/modcloth/make-the-cut-collection?utm_source=blog.modcloth.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=May212012_makethecutcover" target="_blank">collection</a> launch earlier this week,<strong> some of the items are already sold out!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>A good marketing strategy</strong></h3>
<p>If ModCloth wants to offer opportunities for designers to have their designs produced and sold, the contest was also <strong>a way for the company to involve its customers and better target their tastes.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The way most of the industry works is, they produce a design on a large scale, then they send it out to stores and hope customers buy it,&rdquo; Eric Koger says. &ldquo;Ours is a more lean and agile approach. We involve the customer and get feedback earlier in the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan Gregg Koger conclued:&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to help every designer get a real customer for their product&rdquo;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Stüssy Model Strips For 'Likes' In Controversial Viral Facebook Ad Campaign]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3 class="title-news"><strong>St&uuml;ssy Amsterdam has model 'Strip for Likes' on Facebook</strong></h3>
<p>Online clothes retailer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stussy.com/" target="_blank">St&uuml;ssy Amsterdam</a>&nbsp;created a buzz for its last Facebook ad campaign featuring the picture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bundled up&nbsp;model wearing all of the brand&rsquo;s range of clothing,&nbsp;who, as&nbsp;the ad said,&nbsp;strips for "likes."&nbsp;<strong>The more likes the brand received on its&nbsp;Facebook page, the more the model took off her clothes.</strong>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;The campaign created by <strong><a href="http://arnoldamsterdam.com/" target="_blank">Arnold Amsterdam</a></strong>, a new creative agency,&nbsp;<span>has provoked numerous articles and reactions around the globe.</span></span></p>

<h3><strong>An edgy and controversial campaign</strong></h3>
<p>If the campaign was <strong>a success in term of partcipation</strong> (the young model quikly finished half naked) some observers&nbsp;pointed out that the "strip for likes" campaign was<strong>&nbsp;in violation of Facebook's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/page_guidelines.php#promotionsguidelines" target="_hplink">promotional guidelines</a></strong>.&nbsp;The document warn that, "You must not use Facebook features or functionality, such as the Like button, as a voting mechanism for a promotion.&rdquo; Worse, Strussy campaign&nbsp;<a href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2012/04/12/thumbs-down-on-stussys-strip-for-likes-facebook-campaign/" target="_blank">opponents</a>&nbsp;denonced&nbsp;that, once again, the <strong>fashion industry used women as objects</strong> and deplored that this particular campaign sent out a clear message that "the female body is a mere vehicle for selling products."</p>
<p>Since the campaign, the St&uuml;ssy page had received 21,700 likes.</p>

<h3><strong>Myno&amp;Cie, a French&nbsp;manufacturer, is using 3D&nbsp;</strong><strong>rendering pictures to</strong><strong>&nbsp;launch MynoTime, a French Watch using <span>a Suisse mechanism</span>.</strong></h3>
<p>Myno&amp;Cie, a French startup company, has used <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATIA" target="_blank">CATIA</a> the famous 3D software created by <a href="http://www.3ds.com/" target="_blank">Dassault Syst&egrave;mes</a>,</strong> for delivering high resolution pictures of its new customized watches. CATIA LIVE RENDERING was used to produce hyper-realistic 3D rendering pictures in order to offer<strong> a more precise idea of the watches &lsquo;different colors than the real product pictures</strong>. But the innovation doesn&rsquo;t stop here. The watches originality come from its unique design.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[The Book Of the Week - "Functional Aesthetics: Visions in Fashionable Technology" by Sabine Seymour]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>"The Book of the Week"</strong></h2>
<p><em>Each week, FashionLab's editors pick<strong>&nbsp;a must have book</strong>&nbsp;for your bookshelf.</em></p>
<h3><strong>"Functional Aesthetics: Visions in Fashionable Technology"&nbsp;&nbsp;is a book dedicated about w</strong>earable technology in the fashion industry.</h3>
<p>The book itself is&nbsp;about wearable technology in the fashion industry, its history, theory, and practice. The author,&nbsp;<a href="http://moondial.com/seymour/" target="_blank">Sabine Seymour</a>&nbsp;is the Director of Fashionable Technology Lab at&nbsp;<strong>Parsons The New School for Design</strong>&nbsp;in New York and collaborates worldwide at numerous institutions like the<strong>&nbsp;University of Arts and Industrial Design</strong>&nbsp;Linz and the&nbsp;<strong>Swedish School of Textiles</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7218/7315118510_d41bd7ae66_m.jpg" alt="functional aestetics2" /></p>
<h3><strong>A book essentially based on examples</strong></h3>
<p>The main asset of the book is its readibility. Sabine Seymour obviously find herself more into practice than in pure theory. Her<strong>&nbsp;enthralling&nbsp;narrative book</strong> explains in simple terms, different tech and science fields in order to be assimilate to either student, designer, scientist or DIY lovers with a passion for <strong>wearable technology</strong>. To add&nbsp;understandability,&nbsp;Seymour illustrated her work with <strong>a lot&nbsp;of examples</strong>&nbsp;of state-of-the art projects that intersect fashion, design, technology and aesthetics,&nbsp;including&nbsp;relevant information on DIY resources, publications, inspirations, and much more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8163/7315120582_7efd000588_m.jpg" alt="functional aestetics3" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>The book&nbsp;is showing us how the fashion scene has been influenced by new technologies</strong></h3>
<p>Divided into eight chapters (Body sculpture, The Garment as Amplifier of Fantasy, Scientific Couture, The Epidermis as Metaphor, Material Explorations, Transparent Sustainability, Woven Interface and Context as Prerequisite), the book&nbsp;is &nbsp;showing us how, <strong>in the last few years, the fashion scene has been influenced by new technologies</strong>.&nbsp;Bio-organic chemistry, innovative materiasl and soft circuits are the new favourites in the big creative&nbsp;fashion breeding ground and are allowing an almost<strong> non limited crativity</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a mischievous&nbsp;in house joke for the&nbsp;printing and publishing industry, Seymour's book offers <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" target="_blank">QR codes</a></strong> on each of this book page, making "Functional Aesthetics: Visions in Fashionable Technology"&nbsp;<strong>easily readable on mobile phones and tablet devices.</strong></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Stitch Meshes for Modeling Knitted Clothing]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/stitchmeshes/">http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/stitchmeshes/</a></p>
<p>Recent yarn-based simulation techniques permit realistic and efficient dynamic simulation of knitted clothing, but producing the required yarn-level models remains a challenge. The lack of practical modeling techniques significantly limits the diversity and complexity of knitted garments that can be simulated. We propose a new modeling technique that builds yarn-level models of complex knitted garments for virtual characters. We start with a polygonal model that represents the large-scale surface of the knitted cloth. Using this mesh as an input, our interactive modeling tool produces a finer mesh representing the layout of stitches in the garment, which we call the&nbsp;<em>stitch mesh</em>. By manipulating this mesh and assigning stitch types to its faces, the user can replicate a variety of complicated knitting patterns. The curve model representing the yarn is generated from the stitch mesh, then the final shape is computed by a yarn-level physical simulation that locally relaxes the yarn into realistic shape while preserving global shape of the garment and avoiding ``yarn pull-through,'' thereby producing valid yarn geometry suitable for dynamic simulation. Using our system, we can efficiently create yarn-level models of knitted clothing with a rich variety of patterns that would be completely impractical to model using traditional techniques. We show a variety of example knitting patterns and full-scale garments produced using our system.</p>

<h3><strong>Store experience</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3D design hollistic</p>
<h3><strong>3D Design Hollistic, design and virtualization for textiles</strong></h3>
<p>How to introduce the 3D assets: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>3D avatars (consumer&rsquo;s avatars)</li>
<li>garments in 3D</li>
</ul>
<p>3D avatars, to help the designers in their creative process, but also 3D avatars, for the consumer.</p>
<p>Soon any consumer will have the opportunity to have a virtual twin, an avatar, made at its very precise measurements. It will be a revolution, for example, for the online shopping experience.</p>
<p>3D Design and virtualization for textiles is also an &ldquo;helper<strong>&rdquo; </strong>to design garments in 3D, from the very beginning of the creation process to its end. <strong></strong></p>
<p>Before, sketching was all about paper and pen, you started with the front of a garment, then the back. Now, you can create the complete garment directly on a screen in fully 3D. For the first moment a designer is thinking about a silhouette, he can see exactly what he is doing in 3D. With our technology, you can manage your creations in multiple manners. You can change the style, the color, the type of fabric to check how it drapes, make some sourcing tests, obtain the cost to design or the design to cost etc.</p>
<p>A designer can&nbsp;draft new design intent,&nbsp;sketch his collection,&nbsp;design his model in 3D and try infinite changes virtually to choose the bests and make it real.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find more than <strong>200 tips and techniques </strong>for building a great variety of objects and projects:&nbsp;Wearable Tech&nbsp;that will interact with the &ldquo;physical world&rdquo;, but also&nbsp;fun projects like toys, detectors, robots, and suchlike geek gizmos<strong>.&nbsp;Updated for the Arduino 1.0 release</strong>, the recipes in this second edition include practical examples and advices to help you to begin, expand, and improve your projects whether you&rsquo;re an artist, designer, crafter, student, or engineer.</p>
<h3><strong>Not directly for a beginner, more for the intermediate user</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<p>However you don&rsquo;t need experience with Arduino to get started, someone with little or no experience in working with electronics (like gathering components, assembling them, and connecting them) or programming in C could be a little bit lost. That&rsquo;s why <strong>absolute novices may find it easier to start with a real beginners book</strong>. If you have these skills but no experience with Arduino, this book will really help. Anyway, if you buy this book and find it is a little bit too complicated, put it aside carefully. You can always get a more simpler book, then come back to &ldquo;Arduino Cookbook, 2nd Edition Recipes to Begin, Expand, and Enhance Your Projects&rdquo; when you will be ready!&nbsp;You won&rsquo;t regret it: this book serves as an introduction to the broadest range of Arduino capabilities and is like <strong>a bible for Arduino projects</strong>.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Hidden Face of Ray of Life]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><br />Ray of Life</h3>
<p>An original idea by Jonathan Riss, artistic director of Jay Ahr, and by FashionLab, Dassault Syst&egrave;mes technology incubator for fashion. Ray of Life is a visual and sonic film-installation, an immersive experience.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;<a id="yui_3_5_0_3_1340305808926_1033" class="rapidnofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79884939@N02/7415540028/in/photostream" data-track="photo-click"><img id="yui_3_5_0_3_1340305808926_1032" class="pc_img" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7132/7415540028_cba76b6e60_m.jpg" alt="virtual Images (13)" width="240" height="144" border="0" data-thumbdata="" /></a></h3>
<h3><br />Early steps of the project</h3>
<p>Ray of life was born of a meeting between actors from the worlds of fashion, art and technology: the fashion designer, Jonathan Riss, the technology incubator, FashionLab, the American filmmaker, Asa Mader, the sound architects of Soundwalk, and the top model Carmen Kass.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&nbsp;<a id="yui_3_5_0_3_1340305808926_984" class="rapidnofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79884939@N02/7415636958/in/photostream" data-track="photo-click"><img id="yui_3_5_0_3_1340305808926_983" class="pc_img" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8143/7415636958_af3d261f05_m.jpg" alt="virtual Images (10)" width="240" height="129" border="0" data-thumbdata="" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="yui_3_5_0_3_1340305925671_984" class="rapidnofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79884939@N02/7415637354/in/photostream" data-track="photo-click"><img id="yui_3_5_0_3_1340305925671_983" class="pc_img" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5329/7415637354_d965a3dc1f_m.jpg" alt="virtual Images (12)" width="240" height="133" border="0" data-thumbdata="" /></a></h3>
<h3><br />Create new experience for the consumer</h3>
<p>One of the goals of the&nbsp; FashionLab is to use <strong>3D technology to develop new experiences for consumers. </strong>Jonathan Riss, artistic director of&nbsp; Jay Ahr House, is pushing the barriers of what can be done in fashion, leveraging his own great creativity and the technological power of FashionLab. <br />As part of Dassault Syst&egrave;mes&rsquo; focus on considering the needs of the final consumers, <strong>FashionLab, through the Ray of Life, helps bring fashion designers closer to their customers.</strong></p>
<h3>Through this immersive Experience, FashionLab allows to develop new experiences for consumers, and open the door to new usages of the 3D and virtual worlds.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><br />FashionLab at the heart of Ray of Life</h3>
<p>This project is merge of technology, fashion, art and luxury. FashionLab thought about the whole project and was <strong>the vehicle to conceptualize, to convert and to produce the Immersive Experience</strong>. Ray of life is the first immersive consumer project for the fashion world.</p>
<p>35 square meters of screens diffuse a concerto of images, combining filmed sequences with virtual 3D shots. Immersed in a dreamlike journey, the spectator becomes the actor of a rebirth.</p>
<h3>FashionLab conceived the whole project in 3D, by designing and testing virtually the project before it became real, with virtual images and simulation software program.</h3>

<p><br /><em>&ldquo;FashionLab is changing the design and consumer experience scenario in the fashion industry,&rdquo; said J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Bergeret, Director, FashionLab, Dassault Syst&egrave;mes</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Our mission is to introduce 3D technology earlier in the design process and to enable new experiences for consumers, combined with new collaboration and communication tools that respond to the needs and demands of the fashion system. The immersive experience in Florence is clearly illustrating and explaining what we mean.&rdquo;</em></p>

Goodnighties Recovery Sleepwear joins this sentiment with new fabric that helps the body rest, restore and now win in the proverbial &lsquo;game of life&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p class="releaseDateline">Highland Park, Illinois (PRWEB) June 20,&nbsp;2012</p>
<p>Professional athletes and fitness experts alike know a good night&rsquo;s sleep is one of the most important components of any routine.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.goodnighties.com/">Goodnighties Recovery Sleepwear</a>&nbsp;joins this sentiment with new fabric that helps the body rest, restore and now win in the proverbial &lsquo;game of life&rsquo;. The fabric technology used in this new garment is called IonX and it was first introduced in 2005 to professional rugby teams in Australia, South Africa, Ireland and Scotland. The measured performance output when wearing these jerseys made the difference between winning and losing with a net effect of 2.7% improvement in output power and accelerated recovery, according to independent testing at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/?controllerName=search&amp;action=search&amp;channel=business%2Fpress-releases&amp;search=1&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;query=%22Loughborough+University%22">Loughborough University</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;UK.</p>
<p>The idea of using electromagnetic fields saturated with negative ions (as in IonX) provides an overall sense of well-being and an opportunity for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.goodnighties.com/">better sleep</a>&nbsp;quality. It's restorative properties have successfully been used in military uniforms and space suits prior to professional athletic&nbsp;apparel.</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<h3 id="tagline" class="notranslate"><strong>In 2005, Italian engineer Massimo Banzi and his team created the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a>&nbsp;microcontroller</strong></h3>
<p class="notranslate">Computer-based interactivity used to be beyond the reach of most artists, designers, and other electronics amateurs who wanted to make their work respond to light, sound and other stimulus by moving, beeping, tweeting. Then,<strong> in 2005, Italian engineer Massimo Banzi and his team created the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a></strong>&nbsp;microcontroller, a small, cheap programmable computer, bringing interactive technology to the masses.&nbsp;With a variety of sensors, the Arduino is versatile and easy to use.</p>
<h3 class="notranslate"><strong>"You don't need anyone's permission to make something great."&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p class="notranslate">Since its inception, <strong>the device has popped up in projects</strong> as varied as an exhibit on brains at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, to<a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/how-to-make-a-led-umbrella-with-arduino" target="_blank">&nbsp;a programmable LED umbrella</a>, a&nbsp;DIY kit that sends a Tweet when your houseplant needs water or a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/how-to-make-your-dog-writing" target="_blank">persistance of vision vest for your dog!</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;As massimo says,&nbsp;"You don't need anyone's permission to make something great!"&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[The Book Of the Week - "Pattern Magic: Stretch Fabrics" by Tomoko Nakamichi]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>The 3rd book in the series of cult Japanese pattern making books now in English</strong></h2>
<p>Published on&nbsp;<strong>March 2012</strong>,&nbsp;Pattern Magic Stretch Fabrics is the third book in the series of cult Japanese pattern making books "Pattern Magic" wrote by <strong>Tomoko Nakamichi</strong>. The new volume,<strong> recently translated in English</strong>, focuses at working with stretch and jersey fabric. As you know, material that stretches lengthways or sideways can be tricky but also<strong> magical in itself</strong>. This book takes the special qualities of jersey and stretch fabrics and uses them to create stunning, sculptural designs.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8160/7514918058_af5d239e98.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Pattern Magic: Stretch Fabrics&nbsp;is NOT a book to make standard clothes</strong></h2>
<p>Some garments in this book can be done for wear (see a blouse or a pair of draped pants) and some could be done with minor adjustments. We also have seen some of the book styles being used in actual collections (like&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.fashionweekly.com.au/content/standard.asp?name=Sara_Philips_Designer" target="_blank">Sara Philips</a></strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://gailsorronda.portableshops.com/collections" target="_blank">Gail Sorronda</a></strong>). However this book is <strong>not a book to make standard clothes</strong>. If you just want to make standard dress for a party, you might buy another book! &ldquo;Pattern Magic: Stretch Fabrics&rdquo; will help you to <strong>explore pattern making beyond traditional limits</strong>. Like the other series&rsquo; opuses, this book is perfect if you want to explore your creativity, go far beyond your imagination and <strong>learn some new forms to approach pattern making</strong>&hellip; in few words, Nakamichi&rsquo;s book is ideal for fashion design students, fashion professionals, costume designers or anyone with a strong interest in patterns and fabrics manipulation.</p>

<h2><strong>Pattern Magic: Stretch Fabrics&nbsp;is a fantastic reference book</strong></h2>
<p>In two parts, the book shows how to use the <strong>properties of stretch fabrics</strong> through drape and manipulation and how to cut patterns that exploit their properties with <strong>truly original results</strong>. The book is accompanied by a basic paper <strong>pattern block</strong>.&nbsp;The instructions, line drawings and pictures go into great detail. Having some patterns in the book is also a&nbsp;<strong>really&nbsp;great bonus</strong> which gets you excited about trying some of the ideas displayed&nbsp;<span>throughout the pages</span>.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[How To :  Build Your Own Persistence Of Vision Wristband]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2 class="headline"><strong>Party people, wave your wristbands in the&nbsp;air!</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>This "<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/LilyPad-Wrist-Band-POV/" target="_blank">Instructable</a>"&nbsp;will teach you how to build a persistence of vision wristband!</strong></h3>
<p><span><span>Persistence of Vision (POV) is the illusion that an image continues to persist even though the image has changed. &nbsp;In essence, the system is taking advantage of the limitations of the brain-eye processing time.&nbsp;</span></span>The device uses a sewable&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLilyPad">Lilypad Arduino</a>&nbsp;board and about eight 8 LEDs.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8431/7537730740_41331ddef4.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h3><strong>The Lilypad POV (row of LEDs) is a fun gizmo to build with minimal programming and electronic needs.&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>You will have to program the board to get the words of your choice to show up, which will require a bit of patience. However, it&rsquo;s quite a cute illusion and, with enough patience, you can make your wristband say anything you want to say.</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="headline title">More Ridiculous Way To Stay Cool at Work</h1>
<div class="post-body">
<p>And to think last weekend we actually mocked&nbsp;<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5918972/behold-the-most-ridiculous-way-to-stay-cool-at-work">those miniature shoe air conditioners</a>. At least with those you could hide your feet under your desk and no one would be the wiser. It's impossible to hide the ridiculousness of wearing this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P30358/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gmgamzn-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001P30358">Flexi Freeze Ice Vest</a>.</p>
<p>The vest's three removable panels house a total of 96 cubes in all, presumably containing a gel material like is used in freezer packs for a cooler. So you unfortunately can't sacrifice a cube or two to help chill your soda. The vest is actually designed for persons working in high-temperature environments, like say performers wearing a mascot costume. Or for people suffering from conditions that make them particularly heat sensitive. But for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P30358/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gmgamzn-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001P30358">$65</a>, the only thing stopping you from wearing it to work on a hot day is the abuse and ridicule from your co-workers.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[NIKE PRO TURBOSPEED: A Golf Ball-Inspired Track Uniform With Dimples ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2>Nike unveils its new TurboSpeed innovative collection&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Nike Pro TurboSpeed is, as the name hints at,&nbsp;<strong>a track uniform designed to give professional athletes advantages</strong>&nbsp;while racing, and as the famous brand claims,&nbsp;the fastest collection of uniforms it has ever built.&nbsp;Through the clever use of&nbsp;<strong>aerodynamic techniques</strong>&nbsp;more commonly found on golf balls, the company has found a way to reduce milliseconds off a sprinter's time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7273/7538689618_3fc66a16eb.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>A technology inspired by golf balls' dimples&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Following the fluids mecanics studies, the&nbsp;<strong>honeycomb texture present on golf ball</strong>&nbsp;create a turbulent rather than laminar layer of air molecules, which hold to the surface of the golf ball longer and more efficiently than a smooth ball would do. This principle&nbsp;<strong>reduces the wind resistance</strong>. Nike suggests the same principles can be applied to the clothing worn by sprinters, and other athletes.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8421/7538689330_07d3614089.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Patterns&nbsp;have been added on areas of the uniform that correspond of&nbsp;parts of the body which create resistance when we run</strong></h2>
<p>To help with the aerodynamic resistance, Nike has added<strong>&nbsp;particular patterns</strong>&nbsp;to areas of the uniform that correspond of&nbsp;<strong>parts of the body which create resistance when we run</strong>: back, shoulders, arms and calves. The company tested the outfits prototypes for more than 1,000 hours in a special wind tunnel and had insights from some of the fastest athletes in the world.&nbsp;<span>Nike has applied this research to a range of sports, with Track &amp; Field always at its core.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7257/7538689154_0ca0853ee5.jpg" alt="" />&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Wearing the Turbospeed uniform could be the difference between&nbsp;finishing on the podium or not.&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>The effect of these dimples on the fabric, among other features of the uniform, is to&nbsp;offer the&nbsp;<strong>greatest aerodynamic drag reduction</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;reduce up to 0.023 seconds off the time taken to run 100 meters. If 0.023 seconds doesn't sound that much, in the athletes' 100 meters sprint world,<strong>&nbsp;it can be the difference between&nbsp;finishing on the podium or not.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7129/7538689752_dc138ce2d3.jpg" alt="" /></strong></p>
<p>"Reflecting the NIKE commitment to considered design, Nike Pro TurboSpeed merges sustainability and performance. Uniforms in the Nike Pro TurboSpeed collection use an average of 82% recycled polyester fabric and&nbsp;up to an average of 13 recycled plastic bottles. Specific products have been developed for distance, sprint, and field events while strategic color blocking is used to visually capture movement. Specifically for women, NIKE has developed a new approach to modular support, creating specific solutions for the distance, sprint, and field athlete, each offering a different degree of support and adjustability, and integrating Dri-FIT moisture management and premium quality detailing throughout"</p>

    <title><![CDATA[3D Printed Shoes for Olympic Athletes]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Given the complete reliance on technology in creating the shoe, the project showcases the unlimited potential of 3D technologies</strong></h2>
<p>Creative engineer and designer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lucfusaro.com/en/sport/skin/skin.php">Luc Fusaro</a>&nbsp;is using&nbsp;<strong>3D printing technology</strong>&nbsp;to create and manufacture custom built sprinting&nbsp;<strong>shoes for Olympic athletes</strong>. The sprint spikes was Fusaro's&nbsp;final master degree solo project at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rca.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Royal College of Art and Imperial College London</a>&nbsp;where he is currently student.&nbsp;He developed several soles and tested them on athletes by first<strong>&nbsp;scanning their feet to create a digital 3D model</strong>, then designed soles of varying stiffness before producing the physical items from<strong>&nbsp;sintered nylon polymide powder</strong>&nbsp;using an additive <strong>3D printing</strong> technique.</p>
<h2><strong>Current working prototype "Designed to Win" weighs just 96 grams&nbsp;(3.4 oz)</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Forsano tested the various soles in a lab</strong>&nbsp;to calibrate the mechanical properties of the shoe to the physical abilities of the athlete. Then he used the&nbsp;<strong>additive manufacturing process</strong>&nbsp;to produce the final athlete-specific &ldquo;Designed to Win&rdquo; prototype shoe that weighs just 96 g (3.4 oz).</p>
<h2><strong>The shoes could improve an athlete&rsquo;s performance by up to 3.5 percent,&nbsp;when an improvement of 0.7% can already make a significant difference</strong></h2>
<p>Fusaro says his<strong>&nbsp;custom built 3D&nbsp;shoes could improve an athlete&rsquo;s performance</strong>&nbsp;by up to 3.5 percent,&nbsp;when an improvement of 0.7% can already make a significant difference in a sprinter's chance of winning a particular race. While Fusaro&rsquo;s custom shoes won&rsquo;t be on the feet of any athletes at the upcoming London Olympics,&nbsp;<strong>3D printed athlete-specific shoes could become the standard footwear for sprinters</strong>&nbsp;well before the next Olympics in Rio in 2016.</p>
<h2><strong>A design that could disrupt the current production and manufacturing process of the sportswear industry</strong></h2>
<p>Complete with traction elements and shoelace features,&nbsp;<strong>"Designed to Win" is the very first sprint shoe fully made with additive manufacturing</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fusaro is hoping his design will disrupt the current production and manufacturing process of the sportswear industry by using rapid prototyping technologies to produce custom made athletic shoes.&nbsp;</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>A spectacular cubic projections&nbsp;collection made of recycled yarn</strong></h2>
<p>Discover this looks alike<strong>&nbsp;3D pixel art</strong>&nbsp;architectural Autumn/Winter 2012 collection by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hellenvanrees.com/">Hellen van Rees</a>, a young&nbsp;<strong>Dutch</strong>&nbsp;fashion designer.&nbsp;The collection is a merge of her signature&nbsp;<strong>cubic projections</strong>, inspiration coming from&nbsp;<strong>Chanel classic tweed fabrics</strong>&nbsp;and an innovative and noteworthy recyclable intention : &nbsp;indeed, the look like tweed garments are made of recycled yarn.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.hellenvanrees.com/images/squareone/squareone1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2 align="justify"><strong>Designer&rsquo;s words:</strong></h2>
<p align="justify">"This collection was inspired by the tweed fabrics used by Chanel, the straight silhouette of 1920's flapper girls and&nbsp;<strong>3-dimensional</strong>&nbsp;artworks by Anish Kapoor and Rachel Whitebread.<br />The textile is the binding factor of the collection. It's<strong>&nbsp;completely handmade</strong>, from reclyled yarns woven one by one directly in the shape of the garment. Not wasting anything and making the garment including the cubes <strong>totally seamless</strong> as it's woven 3-dimensionally.&nbsp;The yarns and base textile are production factory remnants or old fabrics and scraps taken apart. So&nbsp;<strong>the collection is sustainable</strong>. The cubes added are all in the same textile making the garments, that are based on very traditional ladies garments, into something more subversive and architectural / sculptural.&nbsp;<strong>The blocks themselves are very light</strong>, so they don't distort the garment. Also often they're attached to a pleated skirt allowing them to swoosh in movement making a seemingly static silhouette suddenly dynamic."</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Hybrid Holism: The New Iris Van Herpen's A/W 2012-2013 Collection]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p><span>Dutch designer Iris van Herpen is known for her innovative use of <strong>digital tools</strong>. She relied on 3-D printing technology to design and fabricate her fall/winter 2012 collection (including this dress). The clothes aren't intended for everyday wear&mdash;the fabric is too fragile&mdash;but she believes it will be possible one day to 3-D print washable fabrics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=iris%20van%20herpen&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.irisvanherpen.com%2F&amp;ei=ZokEUNeMF4TC2wXrtpjGBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGquZwf1hjqlAM4Aj2qK3NV5HDNCg" target="_blank">Iris Van Herpen</a>&nbsp;. She&nbsp; studied <strong>Fashion Design at ARTEZ</strong> (Arnhem) and did internships at Alexander McQueen&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each collection of the&nbsp;Netherlands&nbsp;designer&nbsp;refines her obsessively intricate designs laced with handcraft and manipulated with technology. Her latest collection "Hybrid Holism" was inspired by the "living" architectural work of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fashioningtech.com/profiles/blogs/hylozoic-soil-interactive" target="_blank">Philip Beesly</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The showstopper though is a 3D printed dress that looks like its been carved and sculpted out of wax. The details are just beautiful. The dress was a collaboration with architect Julia Koerner.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><em><br /></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 28 years old deutch designer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/irisvanherpen.com">Iris van Herpen</a>&nbsp;h</span><span class="s1">as put&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/tags/3D%20printing">3D printing</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;</span>Haute couture<span class="s1">&nbsp;catwalk. "The first time I used 3D printing, it completely changed my thinking," says van Herpen, who studied under Alexander McQueen in 2005&nbsp;</span>in London and Claudy Jongstra in Amsterdam then&nbsp;started her own label&nbsp;<em>Iris van Herpen</em>&nbsp;in 2007<span class="s1">. "It freed me from all physical limitations. Suddenly, every complex structure was</span>&nbsp;possible and I could create more detail than I ever could by hand."</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The A/W 2012-2013 Collection featured&nbsp;nine 3D-printed pieces in materials ranging from plastics to rubber and metals, in collaboration with architects Julia Koerner&nbsp;Daniel Widrig and Isa&iuml;e Bloch. "When I design, my couture workshop turns into a lab," says van Herpen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">When working on a new collection, van Herpen first sketches and tinkers with complex structures digitally, draping material on to virtual 3D human bodies. Then, engineers at Materialise, a Belgian 3D-printing company, output the final iterations using a pulsed laser that layers powdered plastic or metal into her unique three-dimensional shapes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em>S</em>he explains<em>: &nbsp;&ldquo;For me fashion is an expression of art that is very close related to me and to my body. I see it as my expression of identity combined with desire, moods and cultural setting.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><em>In all my work I try to make clear that fashion is an artistic expression, showing and wearing art, and not just a functional and devoid of content or commercial tool. With my work I intend to show that fashion can certainly have an added value to the world,&nbsp; that it is timeless and that its consumption can be less important then its beginning. Wearing clothing can create a very exciting and imperative form of self-expression. 'Form follows function'&nbsp; is not a slogan with which I concur. On the contrary, I find that forms complement and change the body and thus the emotion. Movement, so essential to and in the body, is just as important in my work. By bringing form, structure and&nbsp; materials together in a new manner, I try to suggest and realize optimal tension and movement</em><em>.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Van Herpen, however, does not want her fashion to be solely technology and no handwork: "Because it would create something really dead," . "So instead I try to combine the two, to create a larger-than-life vision."</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><em><br /></em></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Design And Sell Your Own Custom Fabric with Spoonflower ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Be your own fabric designer&nbsp;</strong></h2>

It offers custom fabric printing with no minimum order as well as as a marketplace of thousands of unique fabric designs by <strong>independent designers</strong> <strong>from around the world</strong>.&nbsp;With Spoonflower you can design <strong>your own fabric</strong> and have it printed to use for, clothing, decoration etc.&nbsp;The idea is actually quite interesting for anyone interested in <strong>special projects</strong> that involve fabric, like&nbsp;quilts, clothes, pillows, dolls, blankets, framed textile art...</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8158/7677591378_8725202999_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Simple process</strong></h2>
<p>The process is simple. You can <strong>upload an image</strong>,&nbsp;a JPG or TIF at 150 DPI and no larger than 25MB&nbsp;(or even a picture!) then&nbsp;you can choose to center your image or repeat it in various ways like half-drop and half-brick.The next step is to <strong>have it printed</strong> on mercerized cotton, heavy twill, organic cotton sateen, linen cotton canevas, silk crepe de Chine...&nbsp;Depending on which fabric type you choose, <strong>prices range</strong> from $17.50 to $38 per yard. Prices go down&nbsp;the more fabric you order. &nbsp;</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Finding properly-fitting clothes is a problem that most of the world has</strong></h2>
<p>To resolve the quest for the <strong>perfect-fitting clothes</strong>, a company called <strong><a href="http://www.bodymetrics.com/" target="_blank">Bodymetrics</a></strong> uses some innovative body-scanning technology to help customers find the ideal garement.&nbsp;"The body is the last piece of information to go digital," <strong>Bodymetrics</strong> CEO and founder <strong>Suran Goonatilake</strong> says. "We use technology to enable a new retail format, and we believe this is the next generation of apparel e-commerce."</p>
<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>
<p>Customers&nbsp;wearing only in underwear or slinky clothes&nbsp;enter in<strong> a circular dressing room</strong> called <strong>"the pod"</strong>. Inside <strong>16 Microsoft&nbsp;Kinect devices</strong> scan the shopper's body. In five seconds, the Kinects take more than <strong>100 different measurements</strong> to make a <strong>3D rendering of the body's shape</strong> and size.&nbsp;The measurement simply maps the body's shape by making an outline with Kinect sensors.</p>
<h2><strong>Soon customers will be able to scan their bodies from their own homes&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Soon, technology will let you<strong> virtually try on clothes</strong> before you buy them online.&nbsp;Bodymetrics spokesman&nbsp;says soon the company will make it possible for customers to scan their bodies from their own homes as the <strong>software will be available for Kinect users</strong>.&nbsp;A good news for online shoppers whom well known problem of finding the right fit online.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Innovative Cork Shell Fabric Won Outdoor Industry Award]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>A brand new technology that combines the outstanding natural features of cork with those of high performance fabrics</strong></h2>
<p>After <strong><a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/a-blanket-made-out-of-wood-that-actually-works" target="_blank">the textile made of wood chips</a></strong>, a <strong>new soft-shell textile</strong> material based on cork convinced the jury of international experts and won one of the ten <strong><a href="http://www.outdoor-show.com/od-en/programme/industry-award.php" target="_blank">OutDoor Industry Gold Awards</a></strong> for a <strong>particularly outstanding product</strong> in the <strong>Material Innovation category</strong>. The new&nbsp; technology named <strong>C<em>orkshell&nbsp;</em></strong> is from Swiss fabric and technology specialists<strong> <a href="http://www.schoeller-textiles.com/" target="_blank">Schoeller Textil AG</a>.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>A material that combines natural&nbsp;<strong>cork granulate and fabric</strong></strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Corkshell&nbsp;</em></strong>is made from an <strong>FSC-certified cork granulate</strong> the same you can found in wine corks. The completely natural granulated cork is pulverized and combined with the fabric. The whole process is <strong>patented from Schoeller</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two&nbsp;<em>corkshell </em>options are available for now. <strong>The first one</strong> features a single layer fabric construction with a cork coating on the inside of the fabric. , <strong>The other one</strong> is a 3-layer fabric construction where the cork coating is sandwiched in a highly breathable lining and stretch, water and wind repellent surface fabric. The product can be <strong>adapted to the requirements of weather conditions</strong>. Since cork has natural stretch properties, <em>corkshell&nbsp;</em>can be offered in both 2-way and 4-way stretch qualities.</p>
<h2><strong>Perfect thermal insulation</strong></h2>
<p>The innovative Swiss company succeeded in combining<strong> the outstanding natural features of cork with those of high performance fabrics</strong> as the new&nbsp;<em>corkshell&nbsp;</em>technology is <strong>certainly the warmest soft-shell ever</strong>.&nbsp;Schoeller spokesman says:&nbsp;&ldquo;C<em>orkshell&nbsp;</em>thus offers a level of thermal insulation<strong> never seen before</strong> while also providing high breathability. It incorporates the positive properties of natural cork without negatively affecting other functional features. In addition,&nbsp;<em>corkshell</em>&nbsp;is bluesign approved and therefore complies with the world&rsquo;s strictest standard for textiles,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Via&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.innovationintextiles.com/corkshell-wins-outdoor-industry-award/" target="_blank">Innovation in Textile</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Every year inventors, hopeful start-ups and established companies compete for the Swiss technology award for innovation. As you'll see in this video, this year&rsquo;s winners included the makers of Corkshell.</span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Continuum Presents its 3D-Printed Shoes Collection ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>When new tech merge with a sensibility for beautiful, wearable design</strong></h2>
<p class="midtype"><strong>Continuum</strong> recently created the buzz with <strong><a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/3d-printed-bikini-by-continuum-fashion">the first 3D printed bikini</a></strong>. The company now combines tech merge with a sensibility for its beautiful, wearable exciting 3D-printed shoes collection,"strvct". &nbsp;</p>
<p class="midtype"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8298/7777786870_d92be75b60_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2 class="midtype"><strong>Innovative materials are used to create&nbsp;incredibly strong, lightweight and&nbsp;arachnidan looking forms</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="midtype">The 3D printed shoe line, named&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;strvct&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;(as a reference to structure) is made with <strong>3D</strong> <strong>printed nylon</strong>. Thanks to this material, the arachnidan looking forms are <strong>incredibly strong</strong> while also incredibly lightweight.&nbsp;The collection represents a range of styles, from a platform to a pump and since the designs are created digitally, <strong>it&rsquo;s possible for the company to produce any variation</strong> in between.</p>
<p class="midtype"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8432/7777784552_1bbc3a07f9_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2 class="midtype"><strong>The collection is wearable and available online</strong></h2>
<p class="midtype">The shoes are lined with a patent leather inner sole, and coated with a synthetic rubber on the bottom to provide traction.&nbsp;<strong>Mary Huang</strong>, one of the <strong><a href="http://www.continuumfashion.com/shoes.html" target="_blank">Continuum</a></strong> founder confess, the 3D printed shoes are<strong>&nbsp;not the most comfortable ever</strong>. Still, it's too bad because the cost is not&nbsp;insignificant as it will cost you<strong>&nbsp;$900 per pair</strong>&nbsp;(made to order).</p>
<p class="midtype">Well, maybe this is the price to pay to jump in the fashion&rsquo;s future&hellip; with style!&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[TshirtOS: The First Wearable and Programmable T-Shirt - Maybe the world’s most advanced piece of digital clothing]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>TshirtOS:&nbsp;100% cotton plateform for digital creativity</strong></h2>
<p>The idea is simple.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/ballantines/app_389541127745161">TshirtOS</a></strong>&nbsp;is essentially a wearable platform with a flexible LED display that connects to your smartphone, opening up a brand&nbsp;<strong>new way</strong>&nbsp;to communicate.&nbsp;<strong>The TshirtOS&nbsp;can display whatever you want</strong>&nbsp;from your tweets or facebook status. It can play music, display artwork or youtube videos, and even&nbsp;<em>take&nbsp;</em>and display photos. And yes, it indeed (and surprisingly) is washable&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8423/7784075920_5a1688bed6_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>The T's&nbsp;also&nbsp;features&nbsp;an accelerometer,&nbsp;speakers,&nbsp;a microphone, and&nbsp;a built-in micro-camera to take and display pictures or videos on the go.<br /></strong></h2>
<p>Introduced by its developpersers as the&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;world&rsquo;s most advanced piece of digital clothing&rdquo;</em>,&nbsp;tshirtOS&nbsp;looks like a simple grey t-shirt.&nbsp;Although easy to use,&nbsp;the<strong>&nbsp;TshirtOS technology</strong>&nbsp;is impressive. It consists of<strong>&nbsp;1,024 LEDs</strong>&nbsp;arranged in a 32 by 32 grid<strong>, 32 microprocessors, and a Bluetooth connection.&nbsp;</strong>You will&nbsp;control your T using an App in your mobile phone that will allow you to broadcast nearly anything. But the LED panel isn&rsquo;t all the garment does. The tee's&nbsp;also&nbsp;features&nbsp;an accelerometer,&nbsp;speakers,&nbsp;a microphone, and&nbsp;a built-in micro-camerato take and display pictures or videos on the go.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8305/7784075272_432fe6b4b8_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Still a prototype, creators register interest&nbsp;from potential buyers</strong></h2>
<p>This project was developed by<strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cutecircuit.com/" target="_blank">CuteCircuit</a></strong>&nbsp;in collaboration with&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.ballantines.com/en" target="_blank">Ballantine's</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;is still in the 'very expensive'&nbsp;prototype stage. However, CuteCircuit and Ballantine&rsquo;s are&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/ballantines/app_389541127745161" target="_blank">listing interest</a></strong>&nbsp;from potential buyers. They aim to&nbsp;<strong>get the price point down</strong>&nbsp;to one that real people may be able to afford it. Really?&nbsp;Go and register... I badly want one!</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Amazon's New Luxury Shopping Site]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>The Internet's all-in-one emporium, Amazon&nbsp;will start selling luxury fashion</strong></h2>
<p>The&nbsp;American&nbsp;multinational&nbsp;electronic commerce&nbsp;company<strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=tsm_1_fb_s_fshn_m8k0io?node=5638716011&amp;pf_rd_p=1389367982&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_i=1036592&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=522331D17E044A40B501" target="_blank">Amazon</a>&nbsp;</strong>, is partnering with <strong>high-end designers</strong>, including Michael Kors, Vivienne Westwood, Catherine Malandrino, and Tracy Reese, to<strong>&nbsp;sell fashion</strong>&nbsp;alongside their lower-priced wares.&nbsp;Amazon's new&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://amzn.to/S7Wih0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">luxury shopping site</a></strong>&nbsp;will let you turn the model 360 degrees to see how the clothes fall and allowes you to see specific fit quirks like how narrow or wide something is.</p>

<h2><strong>Amazon is likely the lead because it takes customer service to a different level&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>As we all know, <strong>customer experience is a huge part of the luxury industry</strong> and many consumers find that perks such as <strong>free shipping, quick service, easy-to-manage</strong> sites and service numbers are an online retailer&rsquo;s version of customer service.&nbsp;Amazon is likely the lead because it takes customer service to a different level.&nbsp;Consumers&nbsp;choose Amazon.com as their preferred online shopping destination because it is <strong>easy to navigate</strong> and does not use <strong>Flash</strong>, according to a luxury tracking study from Unity Marketing.&nbsp;Flash could interfere with site&nbsp;usability, but it also does not enable Apple consumers to view the site on their iPhones, iPod touches or iPads.</p>
<p>"As a category, shopping experiences in apparel are much more fragmented and diverse than many others that we are in," said&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/?controllerName=search&amp;action=search&amp;channel=business&amp;search=1&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;query=%22Russ+Grandinetti%22">Russ Grandinetti</a></strong>, vice president of Amazon's Apparel and Accessories&nbsp;store. He added: "It became clear to us that to build a broad experience, adding more than one brand and more than one format was the right&nbsp;strategy."</p>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[3D Printing Show in London, Oct 19-21 ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>The first of its kind in the UK, the 3D print show promises to show you things that most people still regard as science fiction.</strong></h2>
<p>Taking place on 19th-21st October 2012, the <strong><a href="http://3dprintshow.com/welcome" target="_blank">3D Printshow</a></strong> will be UK's<strong> first major 3D printing trade</strong> and consumer event. The event will host over <strong>70 exhibitors</strong>, ranging from major manufacturers and software developers to design studios, architects and medical companies. The aim is to showcase the <strong>extraordinary range of applications</strong> 3D print technology has and demonstrate to the consumer how it will affect their lives in the future.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8297/7791609814_52e73f27f2_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>The 3D Printshow features live demonstrations, seminars, workshops,&nbsp;full 3D body scanner and&nbsp;a class on 3D fashion and jewellery design</strong></h2>
<p>Organizers are keen for their visitors to engage with the technology in any way they can and leave with <strong>increased knowledge</strong> and understanding. For example they will be setting up a full <strong>3D body scanner</strong>, and a large <strong>design bar</strong> with a row of iMacs and experts on-hand to offer<strong> tuition on design principles</strong>. They will also be running a series of educational workshops and seminars, ranging from a master class in using 3D print to <strong>improve businesses</strong>, to a class on 3D fashion and jewellery design.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8446/7791610050_9bccd4ea8d_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>3D printing has allowed designers to create shapes and textures that they could previously only imagine</strong></h2>
<p>In order to demonstrate the<strong> creative applications of the technology</strong> a dedicated gallery space will house conceptual art and sculpture from approximately <strong>40 different international artists</strong>, including prestigious designers such as <strong><a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~neri/site/index.html" target="_blank">Neri Oxman</a></strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.assaashuach.com/" target="_blank">Assa Ashuach</a></strong>.

    <title><![CDATA[The Book Of the Week - "Techno Fashion" by Bradley Quinn]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>"The Book of the Week"</strong></h2>
<p><em>Each week, FashionLab's editors pick<strong>&nbsp;a must have book</strong>&nbsp;for your bookshelf.</em></p>
<h2><strong>"Techno Fashion" by Bradley Quinn&nbsp;<span>digs the terrain of contemporary fashion and technology</span></strong></h2>
<p>From digital-display dresses to remote control couture, this book exposes the<strong> revolutionary interface between contemporary fashion and technology</strong>. As twenty-first century fashion makes a dramatic departure from traditional methods, designers no longer turn to the past for inspiration, but look to the hi-tech future. The result is<strong> techno fashion</strong>, the new wave of<strong> intelligent clothing</strong> that fuses fashion with communication technology, electronic textiles, and sophisticated design innovations that express new ideas about appearance, construction and wearability. Born out of the collaboration between <strong>fashion designers, researchers and scientists</strong>, this new dialogue could be the most significant design innovation in fashions history, or indicate its eventual demise. Either way, techno fashion promises to forever disrupt the historical narrative of<strong> fashion evolution</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>As technology begins to shape fashion's future, it redefines the boundaries between clothing, body and machine</strong></h2>
<p><span><span>Through<strong> interviews</strong> with designers ranging from innovators such as Hussein Chalayan and Tristan Webber to mavericks like Alexander McQueen, Bradley Quinn examines the impact of this new direction. The<strong> fusion of design and technology</strong> introduced by Yohji Yamamoto, Rei Kawakubo and Issey Miyake has created another direction for clothing, creating<strong> a new breed of designer-cum-scientist</strong> who redefines the way we dress, communicate, and even respond to environmental changes. As<strong> technology begins to shape fashion's future</strong>, it redefines the boundaries between clothing, body and machine, forever transforming the ethics and lifestyles traditionally designated by codes of dress.</span></span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Bio-designed footwear crafted from genetically-engineered stingrays]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Bio-customization&nbsp;technique used to design shoes</strong></h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Rayfish Footwear&nbsp;</strong>company claims it can creates personalized sneakers made from genuine stingray leather. Their groundbreaking&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://rayfish.com/index.php?chapter=biocustomizationprocess">bio-customization</a></strong>&nbsp;technique should allows their customers to design... a&nbsp;<strong>transgenic Rayfish</strong>, so they can save the skin to craft a unique pair of shoes.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8443/7799009236_5015800b5e_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>"One fish, one shoe"</strong></h2>
<p>Instead of printing, or dying the stingray skin, Rayfish Footwear should allows you to&nbsp;<strong>create a unique pattern</strong>&nbsp;for your shoes by<strong>&nbsp;combining fishes genes</strong>&nbsp;from dozens of animal specific patterns and colors. With the&nbsp;<a href="http://rayfish.com/index.php?chapter=growsneaker">design tool</a>&nbsp;available on their website, you can mix them into something nature could have never imagined. "Each pair of shoe is crafted according to the company principle 'one fish, one shoe' principle. "All we have to do is identify the genes responsible for coloration and patterning, and then implant the 'supergene' cluster into fetal rays before they are born. As the ray grows over the course of several months, it gradually expresses the predetermined patterns on its skin," the company spokesman says.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8441/7799077612_1d31c7ae24_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>A concept that seems&nbsp;going&nbsp;beyond the limits&nbsp;of what is now possible with&nbsp;modern genetic engineering</strong></h2>
<p>Concretely, once you've found the perfect match, the company will combine all the different rayfish genetic traits together in its<strong>&nbsp;aquaculture laboratory</strong>&nbsp;in Thailand to produce THE naturally genetic manipulated fish with the<strong>&nbsp;natural skin</strong>&nbsp;that will looks like your design (as close as they can manage, hopefully, nature may have caprices). The concept seems&nbsp;<strong>going&nbsp;beyond the limits</strong>&nbsp;of what is now possible with&nbsp;<strong>modern genetic engineering</strong>&nbsp;but the company website claim they&nbsp;successfully engineered their first fully bio-customized stingray in 2011.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7272/7799007950_f07e74063d_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Rayfish sneakers will&nbsp;cost approximately $1,800</strong></h2>
<p>Rayfish is running a&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://rayfish.com/index.php?chapter=growsneaker">design contest</a></strong>&nbsp;to allow entrants to <strong>win a pair of the sneakers</strong>. The online store will go live after the Grow Your Own Sneaker contest period has ended. Pricing of a pair of genuine Rayfish sneakers currently ranges from&nbsp;<strong>$14,800 to $16,200</strong>, depending on your shoe size and the complexity of the desired pattern.&nbsp;Once regular production will&nbsp;<strong>begin in late 2012</strong>, Rayfish sneakers will&nbsp;<strong>cost approximately $1,800</strong>. This price will include&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://rayfish.com/index.php?chapter=biocustomizationprocess">bio-customization</a></strong>&nbsp;of a pair of stingrays, growing the shoes to maturity, and shipping them to any address on the planet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Updated 16 August 2012</strong>: <strong>On 11 August, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVCE5mAU5E0">video&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;was posted to YouTube where a group of activists claimed they break into the company's&nbsp;aquaculture laboratory and released the transgenic rays into the sea. The idea of animal rights activists releasing genetically-modified organisms into the wild seems completely whimsical. It seems that the whole thing could be an&nbsp;hoax.</strong></h2>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[Nike's first use of waterless fabric dyeing by its Sustainable Business & Innovation Lab]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Nike tests a new technology to dye fabrics without water</strong></h2>
<p>Kenyan marathoner<strong> Abel Kirui</strong> ran for Olympic games in London last summer wearing a<strong> <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/?ref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3D%26esrc%3Ds%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26sqi%3D2%26ved%3D0CDEQFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.nike.com%252F%26ei%3DoHhOUIfuKsnz0gGGxYDYAQ%26usg%3DAFQjCNFfu6fEgeWQlHU5XPqvVX1nIV4b6w%26sig2%3DmMwZi9X-oUYOWeBF7B5wRg" target="_blank">Nike</a></strong> uniform that was dyed in his nation's colors without the use of water.&nbsp;The runner garments mark the first results from Nike's new investment in<strong> <a href="http://www.dyecoo.com/index.html" target="_blank">DyeCoo Textile Systems Inc</a></strong> few times ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually, <strong>it needs a lots of water to dye fabrics</strong>. As an average, between <strong>100 and 150 liters of water is needed just to process a single kilogram of textile materia</strong>l, and the synthetic textile dyeing industry uses 2.4 trillion gallons of water per year. "That's enough to fill 3.7 million competition swimming pools", Nike said.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8036/7974465706_782cc97977_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>A new process that&nbsp;uses fluid carbon dioxide to dye fabric</strong></h2>
<p>DyeCoo designs and manufactures machines using&nbsp;a process that involves <strong>carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;non-toxic gases that come from the waste streams of other industries&nbsp;to dye &nbsp;textile-materials. "The result is <strong>a dyeing process that is not only waterless, but also produces as much as 60 percent fewer carbon emissions than conventional methods</strong>"&nbsp;<a href="http://nikeinc.com/news/kenyan-marathon-champion-to-wear-nike-uniform-of-innovative-sustainable-materials#/inline/13321" target="_blank">Nike says in a news release</a>. The&nbsp;waterfree dyeing process has also considerable lower operational costs compared to the conventional dyeing processes.</p>
<p class="tekst"><span class="ds1">Advantages:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Elimination of water consumption</li>
<li>Elimination of wastewater discharges</li>
<li>Wastewater treatment process eliminated</li>
<li>Elimination of drying and dryer effluent</li>
<li>Reduction in energy consumption</li>
<li>Reduction in air emissions</li>
<li>Reduction in dyeing time</li>
<li>Surfactants and auxiliary chemicals in dyes eliminated</li>
<li>Dye utilization is very high with very little residue dye. Unused dye can be recaptured</li>
<li>Approximately 95% of used CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;will be recycled</li>
<li>Fewer redyes are required</li>
<li>Color correction is easier compared to aqueous dyeing</li>
</ul>
<p>The DyeCoo investment was the first made by Nike's Sustainable Business &amp; Innovation Lab, which have for mission to focus on <strong>making investments in sustainable production technologies</strong>.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Electricfoxy’s Wearable Pilates Instructor]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Workout Clothes Get the Technology Treatment</strong></h2>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jennifer Darmour</strong> is the Seattle-based owner and creative director at <strong><a href="http://www.electricfoxy.com/" target="_blank">electricfoxy</a></strong>, a website that blends fashion, technology and interactive design. She is also a designer, and her newest creation is<strong> a top wich is also a personal trainer.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8284/7827703664_959ed742bf_z.jpg" alt="" /></strong></p>
<h2><strong>A vest that helps&nbsp;to correct the most common errors people make during a mat Pilates class</strong></h2>
<p>The garment, named the <a href="http://electricfoxy.com/move">Move</a>, was presented last July at the <strong><a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/wearable-technologies-conference-on-july-24th-in-san-francisco">Wearable Technologies conference in San Francisco</a></strong>. It has <strong>four stretch-and-bend sensors</strong> strategically placed to help correct the most common errors people make during a mat Pilates class. The sensors are made of <strong>woven conductive thread</strong> and embedded to line the back, front and sides of the&nbsp;vest, <strong>tracking the wearer's movements within 2mm precision</strong>, and <strong>analyzing them</strong> on the go. If the wearer's posture is deemed incorrect, four actuators in the shoulder and hip areas vibrate gently to nudge the wearer into the<strong> right position</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8430/7827704606_5eb5523f65_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2 class="p2"><strong>A dedicated app analyses technique and details performance</strong></h2>
<p class="p2">The tank can also<strong> transmits detailed data</strong> of the wearer&rsquo;s workout to his smart phone via Bluetooth, as an app analyses technique and detail performance. Users can also <strong>record their movement sequences</strong> and set targets for their next sessions, see where they tend to go wrong, and have suggestions on how they can improve.</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8432/7827704090_5dd7419bbf_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="p2">"A lot of designers take a garment and just add blinking lights to it," she says. "That has a place, but we need to <strong>move away from novelty towards really useful</strong>, beautiful systems. What I'm looking at is how you can connect these garments to software and data." As she start to design the Move in early 2010 "<strong>The biggest challenge was the software</strong> and the logic behind that," says Darmour. "Measuring different movements involves a lot of algorithms."</p>
<h2 class="p2"><strong>The wearable instructor</strong></h2>
<p>Darmour reveals <strong>the idea came</strong> to her when she realized how much she was spending with her <strong>Pilates classes</strong>. So she started to think of <strong>ways to help the learning process</strong>. "I thought putting sensors in the clothing could give feedback to help you improve your technique a lot faster," Darmour who works in product design for companies such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/topics/microsoft">Microsoft</a>,<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/topics/google">Google</a>&nbsp;and BlackBerry, says."It's not meant to replace an instructor but it can certainly help you understand the technique even when the instructor isn't around."</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8443/7827705812_43e6288b97_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>"Design, aesthetics and style become core to the experience"</strong></h2>
<p>"As soon as you put these things on your body, design, aesthetics and style become core to the experience," says Darmour. Made from the same kind of materials that are used for regular exercise clothing, the tank is very comfortable and&nbsp;<strong><em>"washing maching friendly"</em></strong>&nbsp;since all the electronic components are removable. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;<img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7139/7827704936_b532c72af9_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="p2">Darmour is now working on incorporating the same kind of sensor technology into<strong> other types of garement</strong> where the practice calls for precise technique to help users whenever they make the wrong move.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[An Inexpensive Fabric Could Recharge Your Cell Phone Using The Heat From Your Body]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Scientists have created technology that would allow you to charge your cell phone in your pocket&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><strong>David Carroll</strong>&nbsp;and his team from <strong><a href="http://www.wfu.edu/nanotech/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Wake Forest University&nbsp;Center for Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials</a></strong>&nbsp;created a technology&nbsp;that would allow you to charge your cell phone in your pocket.&nbsp;&nbsp;"It really started when my daughter, who was 11 at the time, said she wondered if there was a way you could <strong>charge a cell phone using the heat from your body</strong>" Carroll says. "My wife and I were on the phone a lot so our batteries were always dying down." Then, from this idea,&nbsp;Carroll has been working for more than two years&nbsp;to develop the material.</p>
<h2><strong>A material&nbsp;that uses carbon nanotubes on a bed of plastic as conductors of electricity</strong></h2>
<p>Named <strong>Power Felt</strong>, the innovative technology is a&nbsp;material&nbsp;that uses <strong>carbon nanotubes</strong> on a bed of plastic as <strong>conductors of electricity</strong>. The&nbsp;product that<strong> looks and feels like fabric</strong>&nbsp;searches out warmth from the sun or your body heat to produce sufficient energy to recharge small electronic devices</p>

<h2><strong>Power Felt could drastically bring down the price of&nbsp;Thermoelectric Technology</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Thermoelectric technology</strong> exists for years&nbsp;but it's mostly been hampered by expensive materials that can cost up to $1,000 per kilogram.&nbsp;Carroll's team was the first to do it so inexpensively. As the lead scientist on the project said, the material would cost about <strong>$1 to produce a cell phone cover</strong>.</p>
<p>The team now eventually like to <strong>extand the technology</strong>&nbsp;field to clothing and car interiors. Products made of the power felt could appear on the market in a couple of years.</p>

</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"Extreme Beauty: The Body Transformed" by <strong>Harold Koda</strong>&nbsp;<span>Over time and across cultures, extraordinary manipulations of the body have occurred in a continuing evolution of the concept of beauty. Fashion can be seen as the practice of some of the most extreme strategies to conform to shifting concepts of the physical ideal. Various zones of the body--the neck, the shoulders, the bust, the waist, the hips, and the feet--have been constricted, padded, truncated, or extended through subtle visual adjustments of proportion, less subtle prosthesis, and, often, deliberate physical deformation. The book shows that an undeniable if uncanny beauty abides in the bundled cylindricality of a geisha tottering on raised geta or clogs; the tea-tray supporting bustle of an 1880s French visiting dress; the double-door expanse of eighteenth-century panniered court gowns; the bound feet and caged nails of aristocratic Manchu women; the neck-extending chokers of the Masai, of Edwardian beauties, and of John Galliano?s designs for Dior; or the waist suppression of the sixteenth-century iron corsets and the cinches of early-nineteenth-century dandies. The photographs of fashion are augmented by paintings, prints, and drawings, including caricatures by Gilray, Cruikshank, Daumier, and Vernet.</span></div>

    <body><![CDATA[<p class="dark_brown"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">New York Times</a></span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Christopher F. Schuetze</p>
<h2><span>The colorful world of fashion has its dark sides, not least of which is its potential impact on the environment</span></h2>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;Bureau of International Recycling</strong>, an industry advocacy group, claims that a single kilogram of collected used clothing can help reduce up to 3.6 kilograms, or almost 8 pounds, of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions. <strong>Recycling textiles</strong> &mdash; rather than producing new ones from raw materials &mdash; can also eliminate the use of 6000 liters of water (1600 gallons), 300 grams of fertilizer (10 1/2 ounces) and 200 grams, or 7 ounces, of pesticide.</p>

<h2><span>Key to its plan is building a machine that can automatically, quickly and very accurately sort clothes into specific fabrics to be recycled</span></h2>
<p>A consortium in Northern Europe is working toward <strong>getting better value out of discarded clothes</strong>, and, in the process, resizing fashion&rsquo;s carbon footprint.&nbsp;Key to its plan is building a machine that can automatically, <strong>quickly and very accurately</strong> sort clothes into specific fabrics to be recycled.</p>

The very good reviews about the clothes report&nbsp;the perfect way<em>&nbsp;</em>in which the pockets are laid out.&nbsp;All of this ensures<strong>&nbsp;a great and even weight distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Well... fully loaded, you may resemble to&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Gadget" target="_blank">inspector gadget</a></strong>&nbsp;but whatever: it will be nice to avoid paying extra 25 dollars to check a bag when boarding a plane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still,&nbsp;I still have a question. At airport security do you have to take everything out or leave it in the coat?</p>

<h3><strong>&ldquo;Trends Gathering: My Product, Social and Sentiment Analysis&rdquo;:</strong></h3>
<p>Before launching a new product or brand, designers must perfectly understand their environment. To enable them better know, appeal and answer their consumers&rsquo; needs, new technologies are available to help them be innovative.<br />Thanks to the power of search based applications and the easy access to information, a creator can collect quantitative and qualitative information on the need and feelings of future consumers.<br />With these tools, inventors can also measure in real time the reputation of his brand. He can also retrieve and share his consumer&rsquo;s opinions. This will enable them to work with qualitative information to manage new products or ideas.<br />These new tools allow the access to social and consumers&rsquo; analysis to be as close as possible to the consumer expectations and the tendencies.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Le Geek Chic: Wrist Watch]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2 class="itemTitle">It's Half-Past a Binomial Coefficient!</h2>
<p>Regular numbers? Those are for amateurs. Show off your mathematical prowess with a watch that features the equivalent notation of each number.</p>
<p><strong>"Awesome"</strong> should be the world you'll hear the most while wearing this watch. And wait! It looks even better in person than in the online pictures. For $65 it seems a bargain!<br /><br />Unfortunately this<em><strong>&nbsp;Made in China</strong></em> watch is <strong>not particularly well constructed</strong> if we belive <a href="http://www.uncommongoods.com/product/geek-wrist-watch#Reviews" target="_blank">the online product reviews</a>. &nbsp;Several buyers complain the weakness of the mechanism and the band. Also in humid weather some moisture can condensed under the crystal wich is too bad since the watch is not water-proof.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8452/7937196592_22b6fb451a.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>The Cheat Sheet! (included with each watch)</strong>:</h2>
<p><br /><strong>12</strong> - a radical <br /><strong>1</strong> - Legendre's constant is a mathematical constant occurring in a formula conjectured by Adrien-Marie Legendre to capture the asymptotic behavior of the prime-counting function. Its value is now known to be exactly 1. <br /><strong>2</strong> - A joke in the math world: An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar. The first one orders a beer. The second orders half a beer. The third, a quarter of a beer. The bartender says, "You're all idiots," and pours two beers. <br /><strong>3</strong> - A unicode character XML "numeric character reference." <br /><strong>4</strong> - Modular arithmetic, also known as clock arithmetic, is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" after they reach a certain value. The modular multiplicative inverse of 2 (mod 7) is the integer /a/ such that 2*/a/ is congruent to 1 modulo 7. <br /><strong>5</strong> - The Golden Mean...reworked a little. <br /><strong>6</strong> - Three factorial (3*2*1=6) <br /><strong>7</strong> - A repeating decimal that is proven to be exactly equal to 7 with Cauchy's Convergence Test. <br /><strong>8</strong> - Graphical representation of binary code. <br /><strong>9</strong> - An example of a base-4 number, which uses the digits 0, 1, 2 and 3 to represent any real number. <br /><strong>10</strong> - A Binomial Coefficient, also known as the choose function. 5 choose 2 is equal to 5! divided by (2!*(5-2)!) <br /><strong>11</strong> A hexadecimal, or base-16, number.<br /><br /></p>

    <title><![CDATA[FashionLab Incubation Projects, by Jérôme Bergeret]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>The Three&nbsp;FashionLab Incubation Projects</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By&nbsp;J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Bergeret, Director of FashionLab at Dassault Syst&egrave;mes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Trend gathering</li>
<li>Store experience</li>
<li>3D holistic design solutions for fashion&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Footwear</li>
<li>Apparel</li>
<li>Leather goods</li>
<li>Accessories (jewels, watches, glasses)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Trend Gathering</strong></h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Tomorrow moodboard could be created directly virtually!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trend gathering is a&nbsp;<strong>powerful new solutio</strong>n/experience that will&nbsp;<strong>help any designer to manage everything concerning trends</strong>, before he starts to structure his collection: how to leverage his assets, how to collect, manage and take advantage of information found on the web for example. &nbsp;Trend Gathering will combine the&nbsp;<strong>technology from search engine</strong>&nbsp;(Exalead), Social Network (3D SwYm) and&nbsp;<strong>Dynamic/Instant follow-up</strong>&nbsp;of the activity on the net (<em><a href="http://www.netvibes.com/en" target="_blank">Netvibes</a>&nbsp;</em>)</p>
<ul>
<li>From ideation of what&rsquo;s new to moodboard of a new season, collection</li>
<li>Manage growing unstructured web information in easy way (Gather)</li>
<li>Dematerialized the physical moodboard to make it digital and shareable (facebook like)</li>
</ul>
<p>We all know how it could be difficult to make an efficient search. Trends gathering will help to stay connected all the time, to manage the volume of information and to structure the first approach of a new collection. &nbsp;&nbsp;The main goal here, is to<strong>&nbsp;capture the physical mood board and put it digital&nbsp;</strong>by&nbsp;collecting and dematerializing all the physical element usually pinned on a physical board (Piece of string, picture from magazine, raw fabric, color samples&hellip;).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the right information collected, Trend gathering will help to&nbsp;<strong>manage and to structure</strong>&nbsp;it in a collection&nbsp;<strong>trends electronic book sharable electronically</strong>&nbsp;internally or better with a panel of expert and or Consumer directly.</p>
<p>The main output is all the set of information that need to be used as formal input to structured a new season, collection as part of PLM solution (Product Lifecycle Management) ENOVIA.</p>
<p>Gather trends: Search Based Engine Gather Trends from Internal &amp; External (Web unstructured content)</p>
<p>Trend Book: e -Trends Book &amp; inspiration mash up</p>
<p>Mood Board: Digital mood board build &amp; shared</p>
<p>Season Asset: Season started with knowledge trends</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8458/7934110610_0cbf74a9bf_z.jpg" alt="" /></em></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Store Experience</strong></h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>It helps to define the<strong>&nbsp;perfect store strategy</strong>.</p>
<p>Store experience is an application that will cover<strong>&nbsp;all the steps of a store creation</strong>: from 2D Blue print (architect drawing) to the 3D store representation to physical store strategy implementation. Once your store, showroom, corner etc. created in 3D, you will be able, still in 3D, to design new furniture for your store, manage its fitting out and organize it with goods.<strong>&nbsp;You will be able to simulate it to offer the best future experience</strong>&nbsp;for the consumer.</p>
<p>With Store experience, you will be able to<strong>&nbsp;send your virtual store</strong>&nbsp;to a store manager. Better, from a sampled representative store it will be possible to&nbsp;<strong>replicate the new setup</strong>&nbsp;of your initial store to other ones, while keeping all the local constrains in mind (like a different architecture for exemple). Finally&nbsp;you will be able to&nbsp;<strong>measure and analyze the daily P.O.S (Point of Sales) result</strong>, to refine and/or check if you apply the most perfect store strategy!</p>

<p><em><br /></em></p>
<h2><strong>3D Holistic Design Solutions for Fashion</strong></h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>3D Holistic Design Solutions for Fashion is&nbsp;<strong>the way to introduce the 3D assets</strong>&nbsp;at the most early moment in your professional routine it&rsquo;s a revolution and<strong>&nbsp;a door opener for the fashion world</strong>.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;<strong>multidimensional project</strong>&nbsp;will allow, among others, the development of&nbsp;<strong>3D avatars</strong>. 3D avatars can help designers in their creative process, but could be used directly by any person interested in fashion or wearing clothes... that&rsquo;s mean everyone!&nbsp;Soon any consumer will have the opportunity to have<strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;a virtual twin&rdquo;</strong>, an avatar, made at its exact measurements. It will be&nbsp;<strong>a revolution</strong>, for example, for online shopping experience.</p>
<p>3D Holistic Design Solutions for Fashion will also be an &ldquo;helper&rdquo;&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>design garments&nbsp;directly&nbsp;in 3D</strong>, from the very&nbsp;<strong>beginning of a creation process to its end</strong>.</p>
<p>Before, sketching was all about paper and pen. You started with the front of a garment, then the back. Now, you will be able to<strong>&nbsp;create the complete garment directly on a screen in fully 3D</strong>. For the first moment a designer will think about a silhouette, he will&nbsp;see&nbsp;exactly what he will do in 3D. With 3D Holistic Design Solutions for Fashion, a designer will&nbsp;<strong>manage his creations</strong>&nbsp;in multiple manners. He will be able to change the style, the color, the type of fabric, to check how it drapes, make some sourcing tests, obtain the cost to design or the design to cost etc.</p>
<p>Any designer will be able to&nbsp;draft new design intent,&nbsp;sketch his collection,&nbsp;design his model in 3D and<strong>&nbsp;try infinite changes virtually</strong>&nbsp;and choose the best modifications prior to make it real.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designers will have the possibility to<strong>&nbsp;create directly in 3D</strong>&nbsp;and will be able to&nbsp;<strong>spread the 3D process&nbsp;</strong>to the entire product development. 3D Holistic Design Solutions for Fashion will be&nbsp;<strong>sharable</strong>&nbsp;with all internal departments (marketing, sales, panel of consumer&hellip;) and will become the key 3D Garment Asset that will open thousand of&nbsp;<strong>new possibilities for consumers</strong>, in stores, or on the web.&nbsp;</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<p><span class="font-size-2">Recent technological researches, in particular, involving micro-electromechnical systems, have resulted in miniaturized wearable devices that can be used for a range of applications and o</span>ne of the leading areas for utilization of body-fixed sensors is the monitoring of human movementFor those of you who always feel</p>
<p><span class="font-size-2">awkward in your own body, RiSR promises to teach you how to improve your body language for a better, more confident you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="font-size-2">Designed as a net of sensors synced up to an infrared camera, the wearable sensor network corrects your body posture through vibration feedback.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font-size-2"><span>Want to improve your love life or progress in the workplace? A Swiss company, RISR, have designed&nbsp;</span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/10/risr-is-a-sensor-web-you-wear-to-help-your-posture/">a wearable sensor network</a><span>&nbsp;that teaches you to adjust your body language through feedback vibration. Because human interaction in an increasingly digital world is apparently hard enough, the sensors are linked to a smartphone app that scans the wearers &lsquo;target&rsquo; and records their body language. RISR then vibrates on the wearer&rsquo;s body, indicating how they should move in order to ensure maximum engagement and create a &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; posture. The fancy term for this is &lsquo;mirroring,&rsquo; and the gadget claims to ease social anxiety by helping people look, thus feel more comfortable in social situations. To see the RISR in action, watch the video above.&nbsp;Thought you had seen it all? Think again.</span></span></p>
<h1>Sensors-Based Wearable Systems for Monitoring of Human Movement</h1>
<p><span>&nbsp;. An overview of common ambulatory sensors is presented, followed by a summary of the developments in this field, with an emphasis on the clinical applications of falls detection, falls risk assessment, and energy expenditure. The importance of these applications is considerable in light of the global demographic trends and the resultant rise in the occurrence of injurious falls and the decrease of physical activity.</span></p>

<p>One of the biggest news at last week&nbsp;<strong>New York's&nbsp;Fashion Week</strong> had as much to do with technology as it did with fashion.&nbsp;<a href="http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/google-glasses-strut-their-stuff-on-the-catwalk-at-new-york-fashion-week" target="_blank">Diane von Furstenberg&rsquo;s S/S 2013 collection</a>, shown Sunday at New York Fashion Week, featured models, the stylists, and Diane von Furstenberg herself outfitted in Google&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/google-s-project-glass" target="_blank">Project Glass</a>,&nbsp;the new augmented reality Google Glasses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Models walked to the catwalk wearing&nbsp;Google Glasses&nbsp;(color-coordinated to match the model&rsquo;s dresses nonetheless). Then,&nbsp;at the end of the show and&nbsp;as a symbol&nbsp;of a remarkable collaboration between the worlds of fashion and technology,&nbsp;Google CEO Sergey Brin and Diane von Furstenberg arrived together, hand in hand.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Successful Buzz&nbsp;</strong></h2>

    <title><![CDATA[Hug Shirt - How to Send Hugs Over Distance! Send Hugs as easy as you send an SMS]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2 class="post-title"><strong>A high-tech garment that simulates the experience of being hugged</strong></h2>
<p class="post-title">Imagine a high-tech garment that simulates the experience of being embraced by a loved one. Well, this garment exists and its name is simply&nbsp;<strong>"Hug Shirt&trade;"</strong></p>
<p class="post-title">The HugShirt was invented by two designers with a twist:&nbsp;<strong>Francesca Rosella and Ryan Genz</strong>&nbsp;the co-founders of the cult innovative London design company&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.cutecircuit.com/" target="_blank">CuteCircuit</a></strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>A very simple Bluetooth system</strong></h2>
<p>The Hug Shirt uses&nbsp;<strong>Bluetooth technology</strong>. It is an accessory for Java enabled mobile phones and don&rsquo;t have any assigned phone number. All the sent data go from the sensors Bluetooth to your mobile phone and your mobile phone delivers the hug data to your friend&rsquo;s phone and it is seamlessly transmitted Bluetooth to his or her HugShirt! . If you also have a Hug Shirt your friends can send you a hug creating it with the HugMe&trade;<strong>&nbsp;java software</strong>&nbsp;and it will be delivered to your Hug Shirt&trade;!</p>
<h2><strong>Send Unique Hugs as easily as you send SMS</strong></h2>
<p class="post-title">Embedded in the shirt there are&nbsp;<strong>sensors that feel the strength of the touch</strong>, the skin warmth and the heartbeat rate of the sender. So when a friend will send you a virtual hug, your cell phone will notify wirelessly the shirt, via Bluetooth. Your Hug Shirt then will&nbsp;<strong>re-create your friend's unique and distinctive hug, replicating his or her warmth, pressure, duration and even emotion as you&rsquo;ll feel his or her heartbeat</strong>. Sending &ldquo;long distance&rdquo; hugs will become as easy as sending SMS.</p>
<p class="post-title">Note that the Hug Shirt is not yet available for sale&hellip; but creators made a point of honor to&nbsp;well design it so it will be fully washable.</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>MakerBot, the Brooklyn New York based global leader in 3D printing technology, has opened its first shop in NoHo, New York.</strong></h2>
<p>The very first <strong><a href="http://www.makerbot.com/" target="_blank">MakerBot</a> 3D printers retail store</strong> is open to the public since <strong>september 20th</strong> and is located at <strong>298 Mulberry Street</strong>, one of the fanciest street of the area.&nbsp;The opening follows three announcement for MarkerBot all on the same moment: two new <strong>Desktop 3D printers</strong> and a new software package called <strong>MarkerWare</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8177/8022033636_fc0a427ec2_m.jpg" alt="makerbot2" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8318/8022040988_1b986a53f5_m.jpg" alt="makerbot5" /></p>

<h2><strong><strong>A new industrial revolution</strong></strong></h2>
<p><strong><strong></strong></strong>You've already heard about <strong>3D printers</strong>, but you probably don't own one yet.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.brepettis.com/" target="_blank">Bre Pettis</a> CEO of MarkerBot</strong> the replicator 2 will change that.&nbsp;The concept of a home 3d printer is<strong> not science fiction anymore</strong>, but the beginning of a new way to think household consumption&nbsp;and of<strong> a new industrial revolution</strong>.</p>
<p>"I have dreamed of opening this store ever since we started MarkerBot" Bre Pettis says, "Technology like our desktop 3D Printers has to be seen to be belived. <strong>The store is an utopia for creative explorers</strong>, and it's full of markerBot made things that make perfect gifts."</p>

<h2><strong>There is chances you'll own your own 3D printer very soon</strong></h2>
<p>Visitors to the 3D printers retail store will have the opportunity to experience and <strong>watch the whole and fascinating 3D printing process</strong>, as all the printers in the shop as they watch products getting manufactured right in front of their eyes.</p>
<p>They also will be able to buy <strong>'MakerBotted' objects</strong> that have been built right there, or the new Replicator 2 3D printer (<strong>price starting to $2,199</strong>), available for immediate purchase as well as the filament (that you can choose in a panel of 30 different color) used to build your creations. <strong>Eco friendly plastic filament</strong> (called PLA for polylactic acid) are made from cornstarch and<strong> smells like waffles when it prints</strong>. Another good reason to visit the shop!</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Challenges of Fashion]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h3><br />A market growing more complex every day... a paradigm shift for retail... the challenge of sustainability. How will fashion brands be able to keep their edge in the coming years? This man knows.</h3>
<h4><br />To better understand the issues facing the fashion industry today and tomorrow, AxiCom Sweden, PR Agency, had a chat with the pleasant and visionary director of FashionLab at Dassault Syst&egrave;mes, J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Bergeret.</h4>
<h4><br />&nbsp;<br />What do you see as the three largest challenges facing the fashion industry in the next few years?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all: the growing complexity of the market. There are many different types of company, brands, retailers,&nbsp; and each of them will try to apply their own business model to it.</p>
<p>Second, the growing revenue generated by the web channel. This even applies to the luxury industry. Digital is becoming strategic, a mandatory channel, and analysts predict that web sales will surpass traditional retail in 2017.</p>
<p>Third, sustainability is an issue that is steadily growing and that everyone has to address. I believe that 3D and digital technology can solve a lot in that respect.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How can the FashionLab initiative help designers and brands address these issues?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The market will try to apply the best approach to every brand. So, by analyzing consumer demand better, brands can minimize the stock, and actually reduce the volume of confection, while increasing sales.<br />The next step is to deliver to companies the capability to offer digital products to the consumer in a way that brings the experience closer to what consumers get in a physical store.</p>
<p>In the not-so-far future we could see magic mirrors in the store itself, with a virtual model based on your body that could provide a side-by-side comparison, even from a panel of experts. The experience must be natural - technology is at its most beautiful when it isn&rsquo;t visible. <br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Jerome Bergeret joined Dassault Syst&egrave;mes in 2007 and was appointed Director of FashionLab in 2011. He is working closely with key influencers in the fashion industry.&nbsp; Previously, Bergeret worked in senior consulting and business development roles for a variety of software companies to deliver solutions to number of fashion customers.</em><br />&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[The Book Of the Week - "Eco Fashion" by Sass Brown]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<div>
<h2><strong>"The Book of the Week"</strong></h2>
<p><em>Each week, FashionLab's editors pick<strong>&nbsp;a must have book</strong>&nbsp;for your bookshelf.</em></p>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;Eco Fashion&rdquo; looks at one of the strongest trends in fashion, towards the production of desirable and well-designed apparel and accessories with a conscience&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Originally from London, England, Sass Brown teaches in the Fashion Design department at the <a href="http://www.fitnyc.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>FIT</strong> (Fashion Institute of Technology)</a> in New York. She has worked with women's cooperatives in Latin America, most notably COOPA-ROCA in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>
<p>Her book &ldquo;Eco fashion&rdquo; shows the range of <strong>sustainable and ethical products</strong> available around the globe and <strong>explains the stories behind them</strong>, as well as showing how and where they make a difference. In this book, Brown calls attention to the many independent designers who are <strong>bringing environmentally-friendly fashion to the next level</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>This book makes an important contribution to the global movement for ecology-in-design and provides an excellent overview of this emerging field.</strong></h2>
<p>As Professor Frances Corner, Head of College London College of Fashion says 'Eco Fashion is a thoughtful and <strong>stimulating publication</strong> that comprehensively covers the way companies and designers are responding to the challenge of creating a more<strong> environmentally friendly yet design-led fashion industry</strong>. What is perhaps unique about this publication is how it provides both an insight into the key drivers behind developing an eco fashion industry, whilst at the same time acting as<strong> a guide to the designers and fashion companies</strong> who are tackling these issues. This publication never loses sight of the importance of creating fashionable and exciting clothes if we are to have a sustainable fashion industry.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adidas.com/us/?cm_mmc=AdieSEM_Google-_-Trademark-B-Exact-_-Trademark-X-X-General-_-adidas&amp;cm_mmca1=US&amp;cm_mmca2=Exact" target="_blank">Adidas</a> launched&nbsp;today, October 1st,&nbsp;a new kind of<strong> interactive window shopping experience</strong> that allows customers to order garments and accessoiries while passing in front of the window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new storefront window is a fully functioning <strong>virtual store with life-size products</strong>. The intuitive interface of the touch-screen window lets shoppers explore, play and drag life-size products they are interested in directly into their smartphone for<strong> easy and convenient purchase from adidas NEO online</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>Window shopping experience with giant screen that allow customers to order garments and accessories</strong></h2>
<p>By visiting a simple URL via their smartphone and typing in a one-time PIN, the shopper&rsquo;s mobile becomes <strong>interlinked in real time with a shopping bag on the window</strong>, showing a live view of its contents. Any product dropped into the window&rsquo;s shopping bag instantly appears on the mobile. The <strong>shopper can edit product details</strong>, save products for immediate or later purchase and share with friends through social media or email.</p>
<p>Shoppers can also play with a <strong>life-size digital model</strong> showcasing NEO&rsquo;s fashion range in a fun and engaging way. By touching hotspots on the window the shopper can make the mannequin show product details, interact with the product and make playful actions and movements.</p>
<p><span>This new simple technology is used as part of a&nbsp;six-week pilot test at the adidas NEO Label store-front in N&uuml;rnberg.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[The electronic underpants that text you when you wet yourself]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Wearable technology can sometimes seem an oddball field, a realm for DIY enthusiasts and conceptual artists sooner than for serious technologists--but as it enters realms like the hospital, wearable tech appears to be growing into a real industry. It's not the first time researchers have proposed using wearable technology in the hospital--consider, for instance, earlier reports of&nbsp;<a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/electronic-underpants-come-to-nsw-20100326-r0jt.html" target="_blank">electronic underpants that text you when you wet yourself</a>.</span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Baby Onesie Designed to Monitor Infants as They Sleep]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2 class="entry-title">Wireless baby onesie will help parents sleep better too</h2>
<p>Parents are ready to buy anything from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/Summer-Infant-Day-Night-Baby-Video-Monitor/10928614">video monitor</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;movement-sensing pad&nbsp;to make sure their little one is sound sleeping through the night.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.restdevices.com/">Rest Devices</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;Boston startup&nbsp;understood very well that need and&nbsp;have found a better way to monitor sleeping infants.&nbsp;They developped&nbsp;a wearable baby&nbsp;onesie embedded with&nbsp;with built-in <strong>sensors&nbsp;that can report on baby's&nbsp;vital signs</strong>&nbsp;(breathing, temperature, and movement)&nbsp;<strong>over Wi-Fi</strong> to parents&rsquo; smartphones, tablets, or other connected devices.&nbsp;"New parents want to know how their baby is doing at all times," says CEO&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/thomas-lipoma/2b/69a/236">Thomas Lipoma</a>. "This can tell you if your baby is on her stomach or her back, if her temperature spikes, if she's moving around, and if she's breathing normally." That last factor, of course, is a major fear for parents, who worry about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002533/">sudden infant death syndrome</a>, or SIDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<address>Lipoma, on the right, with Dulcie Madden, Rest&rsquo;s head of business development</address>
<h2><strong>Sensors&nbsp;that can report on baby's&nbsp;vital signs&nbsp;over Wi-Fi</strong></h2>
<p>The garment technologie hides in stretchy green bands on the onesie.&nbsp;<strong>Captors will collect information</strong>&nbsp;about the infant's respiration as her chest rises and falls.&nbsp;<strong>Temperature and movement sensors</strong>&nbsp;will be built into a&nbsp;turtle-shaped transmitter&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;which right now is produced by a 3-D printer at Rest's Leather District headquarters &mdash;&nbsp;and an audio monitor will be built into the base station. <strong>The whole system will be able to send alerts to a mobile phone</strong>, or log data from night to night on a website, allowing parents to look for trends. "We like to call it 'quantified baby,'" says Madden, referring to the "quantified self"&nbsp;data-gathering movement.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/assets_c/2012/08/onesie-thumb-300x402-80081.jpg" alt="onesie.jpg" /></p>
<h2><strong>The product should hit&nbsp;the market later this year</strong></h2>
<p>Aiming for a price somewhere between $100 and $200, the onesies'&nbsp;package would include three onesies, a small turtle-shaped transmitter that clips onto the front with magnets, and a plug-in base station that would<strong> send data from the nursery over a home's WiFi network.</strong> (Another option is that the transmitter could communicate directly with a Bluetooth phone.)</p>

    <title><![CDATA[“Like-A-Hug” Vest Gives You a Squeeze for Every Facebook “Like” You Get]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>A vest that gives you a squeeze to let you know you&rsquo;re loved and supported. No matter where you are.</strong></h2>
<p><span><span><strong><em>Like-A-Hug</em></strong><span>&nbsp;is a wearable social media vest that <strong>allows for hugs to be given</strong> via Facebook, bringing us closer despite physical distance. &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.melissakitchow.com/" target="_blank">Melissa Kit Chow</a></strong>, a graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, wanted to convert these likes into a real-time show of love and support, no matter where you are. With&nbsp;<strong>Andy Payne and Phil Seaton&nbsp;</strong>students at the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/like-a-hug-vest-gives-you-a-hug-when-you-get-a-facebook-like/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology&nbsp;Media Lab&nbsp;</a></strong>&nbsp;they have developed this vest that inflates when friends 'Like' a photo, video, or status update on the wearer's wall, thereby allowing us to feel the warmth, encouragement, support, or love that we feel when we receive hugs. <strong>Hugs can also be sent back</strong> to the original sender by squeezing the vest and deflating it.</span><br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><img src="http://payload75.cargocollective.com/1/3/121812/3818595/inflato-jacket_small.jpg" alt="" /></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br /></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The concept came over a casual conversation about&nbsp;long-distance relationships</strong></h2>
<p>The project was done as an <strong>exercise and exploration</strong> in shape display. We came up with the concept over a casual conversation about <strong>long-distance relationships</strong> and the limitations of video chat interfaces like Skype. The concept of telepresence arose, and we toyed with the idea of receiving hugs via wireless technology. The result was&nbsp;<em>Like-A-Hug</em>. Connecting it to Facebook conceptually was <strong>simply a way to explore how social media might push past the traditional graphic user interface</strong> (GUI).</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Tender: A programmable Touch Sensitive Illuminated Garment]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>A garment that exhibits a structural knit textile with programmable microchips integrated into the material.</strong></h2>
<p>Tender is an <strong>interactive illuminated garment</strong>&nbsp;that reacts to stroking. It lights up separate pockets on the body according to how they have been in contact with the skin. By<strong> stroking the&nbsp;garment</strong> it is possible to &ldquo;move&rdquo; the lighted part of the wearable. It can be used to gather light around the neck, chest area for reading, hands area for&nbsp;spotlight to find something in darkness or for all kind of other playful effects.&nbsp;It&nbsp;<strong>can be programmed to react on different inputs</strong>, perform a&nbsp;range of actions and give desirable output. <strong>Touch sensitive garment</strong> is one of many possible&nbsp;applications of the developed textile.</p>
<h2><strong>A first prototype born from a collaborative project&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Born from a&nbsp;<strong>CRISP Smart Textile Services</strong>&nbsp;collaborative project between&nbsp;<strong>Kristi Kuusk, Martijn ten Bh&ouml;mer, Paula Kassenaar</strong> and the <strong>Textielmuseum Tilburg</strong>, Tender represents the value of the new craftsmanship. It is a combination of structural knitting, electronics and conceptual fur-bubble inspired look. It&nbsp;suggests the soft light and personalized interaction to be the luxury of today.</p>
<p>It is <strong>a first prototype</strong> that will be developed further as part of the ongoing CRISP project.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Smart Hospital Gown]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2>When Wearable Technology Goes to the Hospital</h2>
<p>This easily&nbsp;<strong>washable piece of wearable tech</strong>&nbsp;isn't haute couture, but is packed with&nbsp;<strong>state-of-the-art-technology</strong>&nbsp;and could&nbsp;<strong>revolutionize medicine.</strong>&nbsp;Researchers at the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/home">"Universidad Carlos III"</a></strong>&nbsp;in Madrid have developed an intelligent&nbsp;hospital&nbsp;shirt&nbsp;that can monitor and&nbsp;register a number of the patient&rsquo;s physiological parameters in a non-intrusive manner, including temperature, heart rate, etc. &nbsp;The gown can also locate a patient within a two-meter margin of error.&nbsp;<strong>Completely wireless</strong>, it can pinpoint a patient's location and tell a doctor whether the patient is sitting, standing, lying down,&nbsp;walking or running.&nbsp;&ldquo;The information gathered by <strong>an intelligent t-shirt</strong> using <strong>e-textile technology</strong> is sent, without using wires, to an information management system, which then shows the patient&rsquo;s location and vital signs in real time&rdquo;, explain the UC3M researchers. "The system is designed to be used in hospitals and can be divided into two parts: the <strong>fixed infrastructure</strong>, which would be pre-installed in the hospital, and <strong>the mobile units</strong>, which would move with the patients."&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.uc3m.es/portal/pls/portal/docs/15430859.JPG" alt="Sensor and t-shirt" />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://www.uc3m.es/portal/pls/portal/docs/15430862.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>The technology could also be applied in other areas, such as applications involving early diagnosis or telemedicine</strong></h2>
<p>The madrilene university&nbsp;claims&nbsp;in its <a href="http://www.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/actualidad_cientifica/noticias/intelligent_tshirts">press release</a>: "With slight modifications,&nbsp;<strong>the prototype can also be applied in other areas,</strong>&nbsp;such as applications involving early diagnosis of cardiac anomalies in athletes, or for telemedicine, to monitor patients in [their] homes, thus reducing the time they must remain admitted to the hospital." &nbsp;The gown can also be&nbsp;<strong>configured&nbsp;to alert the doctor</strong>&nbsp;if some of the patient parameters are abnormal.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Cell Phone Dress]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2 class="post-title"><strong>The Little Black Dress That's Also a Cell&nbsp;Phone</strong></h2>
<p><span id="intellitxt">CuteCircuit has created the <strong>geekiest version ever of "the little black dress"</strong>. Called the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.cutecircuit.com/m-dress/" target="_blank">M-Dress</a>&nbsp;(Mobile Phone Dress)&nbsp;</strong>this classic and elegant silk jersey dress&nbsp;&nbsp;is also a functional soft electronics mobile phone. The dress&nbsp;works in &nbsp;<strong>an easy and intuitive way</strong>: when the phone "rings", answering an incoming call is as simple as bringing&nbsp;a palm&nbsp;to the ear, except that you don't actually hold a handset in your hand. To end the call, you just have to lower the hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>The M-Dress accepts a standard SIM card so you can receive and make calls without carrying a cellular phone</strong></h2>
<p>The garment&nbsp;contains <strong>a slot that is sewn beneath the label</strong> to place your cell phone's SIM card.&nbsp;Like<strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/hug-shirt-how-to-send-hugs-over-distance" target="_blank">the&nbsp;Hug Shirt</a></strong>, the M-Dress has <strong>technology woven into its fabric:</strong>&nbsp;the soft circuitry and antenna are hidden along the bottom hems.&nbsp;The M-Dress was designed after CuteCircuit designers research showed that very often phone calls are missed because mobile phones are difficult to found in a purse or&nbsp;quite awkward to&nbsp;carry, because most of the time, women, have garments with small or no pockets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The situations posed by this "phonedress", though, are substantial. With <strong>no screen or display</strong>, you can only dial out few pre-programmed number, and you will have no idea who's calling you!&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[The Book Of the Week - "The Knockoff Economy: How Imitation Sparks Innovation" by Kal Raustiala and Christopher Sprigman]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>"The Book of the Week"</strong></h2>
<p><em>Each week, FashionLab's editors pick<strong>&nbsp;a must have book</strong>&nbsp;for your bookshelf.</em></p>
<h2>The Knockoff Economy: How Imitation Sparks Innovation" by Kal Raustiala and Christopher Sprigman&nbsp;is all&nbsp;about copying and how&nbsp;copying and creativity can co-exist.</h2>
<p><a title="amazon link" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195399781/thevolocons0d-20/" target="_blank"><em>The Knockoff Economy</em></a>&nbsp;is a book about copying, and specifically about how copying, copyright, and creativity mix in a set of somewhat unusual industries&mdash;from fashion to food to football. Though the book main focus is copyright, it also tackle patent and other forms of intellectual property.</p>
<h2><strong>Fashion is all about trends, and trends are all about copying</strong></h2>
<p>Autors&nbsp;<em><strong>Kal Raustiala</strong></em>&nbsp;(<em>Professor of Law at UCLA and the author of&nbsp;<em>Does the Constitution Follow the Flag?) and&nbsp;<em><strong>Christopher Sprigman</strong>&nbsp;(Class of 1963 Research Professor at the University of Virginia School of Law)&nbsp;</em></em></em>have some good news:&nbsp;<strong>copying and creativity can co-exist</strong>. Using extensive industry case studies of fashion, fonts, jokes, recipes, and other sectors, Raustiala and Springman gently remind us that a coherent intellectual property policy inherently involves trading off protection and imitation. And if they&nbsp;think that<strong> intellectual property&nbsp;laws are necessary</strong>, the interesting and important question asked in this work is&nbsp;<em>how much</em>&nbsp;intellectual property protection is necessary to spur creativity and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.volokh.com/2012/10/15/the-knockoff-economy-how-imitation-sparks-innovation/raustiala_knockoff_cover_hires-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-66112"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-66112" title="Raustiala_Knockoff_cover_hires" src="http://1-ps.googleusercontent.com/h/www.volokh.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/158x240xRaustiala_Knockoff_cover_hires3-198x300.jpg.pagespeed.ic.5umaxPFY-F.jpg" alt="" width="158" height="240" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Words from the authors :</strong></h2>
<p>"First, fashion is an intensely status-based enterprise, and so the freedom to copy&mdash;which allows designs to filter into the broader marketplace more swiftly&mdash;also means that designs become popular more swiftly. That in turn induces those who value standing out to seek a new design. <strong>Copying helps trends get started more quickly. And it kills them more quickly as well</strong>, as the fashion-forward move away from designs that have become overexposed. And as they do, designers have to be ready with new designs. In short, copying acts as a turbo-charger on the fashion cycle.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>fashion is all about trends, and trends are all about copying</strong>. This is implicit in what we just wrote. But copy-driven trendmaking has another feature. Trends are what help the trend-seeking to know what to wear to remain in style. Trends, in other words, help organize and anchor the fashion industry&rsquo;s output into identifiable categories. This anchoring spurs sales, since for many consumers they don&rsquo;t want to stand out, but instead to fit in. &nbsp;Copying helps lowers consumers&rsquo; information costs regarding what&rsquo;s in style at any given moment.</p>
<p>As a result of these phenomena, the <strong>freedom to copy that exists in fashion is not a drag on innovation&mdash;it is spur for it.</strong> That has implications for the occasional efforts in Congress to extend some form of copyright to fashion. But it also has larger implications, in particular for the notion that IP is a necessary element in spurring creative work.</p>
<p>And as we explain in the book, this pattern of copying coexisting with creativity is not unique to fashion. In the coming days we&rsquo;ll post about some of the other industries we explore, and also discuss some of the broader questions that emerge from our study."</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Tweeting Dress]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2>The dress that fashionably displays tweets</h2>
<p>Composed of a bodice, corset, and skirt, the&nbsp;Microsoft's&nbsp;tweeting dress&nbsp;is made of paper and was&nbsp;<strong>stitched together completely by hand. </strong>The dress&nbsp;was designed to be anything but subtle and&nbsp;intentionally evokes the past. To reflect the ubiquity of texting on the go, the designers integrated a custom keyboard designed like a vintage typewriter, that allows the wearer to send&nbsp;140-character message, which is then displayed on the dress&nbsp;<strong>through a projector</strong>.</p>
<p>Featuring latest wearable technology, the dress displays four&nbsp;<a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/massimo-banzi-how-arduino-is-open-sourcing-imagination" target="_blank">LilyPad Arduino</a> boards, one USB hub, a laptop, a capacitive keyboard, solid and stranded wire, and a short-throw projector. Hitting a key sends it to the laptop, which then displays the character as animated text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some may be repelled by its ostentatious presentation, while others might dare to imagine a more transparent and open world,&rdquo; say the designers <span>Roseway and Small&nbsp;</span>. &ldquo;It is our hope that this piece will inspire conversations that go beyond&nbsp;fashion or technology&nbsp;to topics such as awareness, accountability, privacy, and identity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Cancer-Detecting Bra Could Soon Surpass Mammograms in Accuracy]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>This bra uses sensors that can detect heat changes in breast tissue&nbsp;which may signal the growth of tumors</strong></h2>
<p>Breast&nbsp;<strong>cancer is easier to defeat the earlier it's detected</strong>. And while getting a monthly mammogram to detect it in its earliest stages is impractical, wearing a&nbsp;<strong>smart bra</strong>&nbsp;that can do the almost same job than a screening isn't.&nbsp;Using&nbsp;<strong>extremely precise sensors</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.firstwarningsystems.com/" target="_blank">First Warning Systems Bra</a></strong>&nbsp;will be able to&nbsp;detect heat changes in breast tissue (caused by new blood vessel growth) that can be associated with a possible&nbsp;tumor activity. Then the bra sends information to a computer where it&rsquo;s analyzed and processed by a dedicated software that uses an algorithm to study the temperature changes and look for signs of&nbsp;growing&nbsp;tumor.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.firstwarningsystems.com/sites/all/themes/zen/fws/images/technology-graph1.gif" alt="" /></p>
<address>Measuring Abnormal Cell Cycles</address>
<h2><strong>Tests show the bra is far superior and may be able to detect tumors growth up to 6 years sooner than self-exams or mammograms</strong></h2>
<p>And while it sounds like a concept that's years away from becoming a reality, the device has already undergone testing for sensitivity and accuracy in three clinical trials with 650 women.&nbsp;Tests so far are showing that the bra is far superior and may be able to detect cancerous growth up to 6 years sooner than self-exams or mammograms.&nbsp;If an upcoming final clinical test shows similar positive results, the bra could be&nbsp;available and&nbsp;commercialized&nbsp;in Europe in 2013 and in the US by 2014&nbsp;pending FDA approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Alpha: the heart rate monitor that's also a watch...]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>The world's first strapless, continuous heart rate monitor&nbsp;you can wear on your wrist</strong></h2>
<p>Heart rate monitoring is useful and beneficial to athletes, helping them <strong>optimize their training, control their intensity level, and preventing over- and under-training</strong>. But any runner knows: efficients heart-rate monitors&nbsp;involve chest straps and bulky armbands or wristwatches to get the job done.</p>
<p>Creator of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shape-Elite-Heart-Monitor-Watch/product-reviews/B000F7L020">MIO watch</a>, Dickinson,&nbsp;has partnered with<strong>&nbsp;Philips Electronics</strong>&nbsp;to create <strong>a new watch</strong> <strong>that's also an&nbsp;heart rate monitor</strong>. Called the Alpha, it&nbsp;is the world's first strapless, continuous heart rate monitor you can wear on your wrist that&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t involve a chest strap,&nbsp;and, in testing, has been <strong>tested EKG-accurate</strong> even while you are running at performance speeds of up to 20km/h (12mph)!</p>
<p>The Alpha has a simple white-framed face and comes with a breathable black strap. It tells time, has a timer, gives both visual and audio alerts when the wearer moves in and out of heart-rate zones, and offers a &ldquo;last run&rdquo; statistics review.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How It Works?</strong></h2>
<p>The device is really intuitive with <strong>just two buttons</strong> to push and only the most essential features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous heart rate display</li>
<li>User settable heart rate zones with visual and audible alerts</li>
<li>Data review (total exercise time; average heart rate; time "in zone")</li>
<li>Timer</li>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>Bluetooth Smart connectivity</li>
</ul>
<p>Two light beams and an electro-optical cell "sense" the volume of blood under the wrist skin that pulsates in the rhythm of the heart, and so does the&nbsp;<strong>signal from the electro-optical cell</strong>. This signal is processed by an advanced electronics circuit and passed on to a highly specialized computer program that is embedded in the watch. To avoid the interferences caused by&nbsp;the arm movements while walking or running strongly&nbsp;with the electro-optical signal to the point that it is no longer possible to extract the heart rate from it, the watch&nbsp;has been provided with&nbsp;<strong>a separate motion detector.</strong>&nbsp;The computer program is able to use the information from this detector to compensate for the disturbance that is generated in the electro-optical signal by walking or running motions. As a result, the device can display an accurate heart rate even during motion-intense activities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goal with this tech was to <strong>eliminate the muscle noise</strong>,&rdquo; Dickinson said in an interview. &ldquo;The wrist moves so much and there&rsquo;s so much ambient noise that in the past it&rsquo;s been hard to get just the heart rate.&rdquo; She said that paying a visit to the Philips company in the Netherlands two years ago convinced her this device could be done.</p>
<p><img src="http://alphaheartrate.com/img/alpha_hrzones.jpg" alt="Alpha Heart Rate Zones" /></p>
<h2><strong>BLUETOOTH SMART CONNECTIVITY</strong></h2>
<p>Alpha is&nbsp;<strong>compatible&nbsp;with all smart phones featuring Bluetooth 4.0.</strong> (iOS and Android) and certain fitness apps, like RunKeeper.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the watch&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;offer built-in GPS or an accelerometer, so it can&rsquo;t measure speed, distance or pace and&nbsp;<strong>you'll have to use your favorite smart phone app</strong>. to get this part of the job done!&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[The Book Of the Week - "Sew Eco: Sewing Sustainable and Re-Used Materials" by Ruth Singer]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>"The Book of the Week"</strong></h2>
<p><em>Each week, FashionLab's editors pick<strong>&nbsp;a must have book</strong>&nbsp;for your bookshelf.</em></p>
<h2>Sustainable sewing projects don't have to be scratchy hemp skirts and brown patchwork aprons!</h2>
<p><em>This book will guide readers through a series of stylish sewing projects with a focus on sourcing and using sustainable fabrics</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ruthsinger.com/" target="_blank">Ruth Singer</a>&nbsp;is a textile designer-maker who works exclusively with eco-friendly, recycled and natural fabrics. She has also worked in museum education, most recently in adult education at the V&amp;A.

<h2><strong>This book is a fun, practical and informative guide to approaching needlework and crafting in an environmentally responsible way</strong></h2>
<p><strong></strong>This book will guide readers through a series of 20 stylish sewing projects with a focus on sourcing and using sustainable fabrics. The projects teach different aspects of sewing, starting with making cushions from recycled shirts, old jumpers, vintage buttons and other materials, working through making simple skirts and bags, to using leather applique, working with vintage lace and peace silk, using organic fabrics for scarves and shawls and even 'upcycling' an old suede skirt or hat into something new and fabulous.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[ 3D interactive shopping experience provided by Adidas called adiVERSE]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>Adidas have created an&nbsp;in-store&nbsp;digital experience to showcase their 8,000+ shoe range. It can be deployed to allow almost any retailer to sell the entire Adidas product range without having to be a flagship store in a major city, which is a huge win for all sorts of retailers big and small.</p>
<p>The experience is&nbsp;defined&nbsp;by a large footwear&nbsp;wall, made of multiple LCD touch screens that use facial&nbsp;recognition&nbsp;to detect a customers gender on approach to the wall. The&nbsp;<strong>adiVerse virtual&nbsp;footwear&nbsp;wall</strong>&nbsp;then customises the product experience for that gender, and helps guide them to the perfect shoe, or alternatively, let&rsquo;s them browse the entire range of products, with each rendered in real-time 3D (hence the Intel partnership).</p>
<p>The user has the ability to&nbsp;<strong>shop for the shoe digitally in the store</strong>. The Adidas adiVERSE wall can also sway the skeptic by letting consumers<strong>&nbsp;read objective reviews and tweets from around the&nbsp;Web</strong>, good or bad, giving the ultimate decision to the consumer.</p>
<p>The most popular products get the full content play, with videos, game stats, product specs and even twitter feeds fed through to the customer. Customers can even add product into their virtual cart, and check out via an iPad that sales staff would hold, paying with credit card or cash.</p>
<p>While there are a few things left to be desired with the adiVerse Virtual Footwear Wall, its a great step in the right direction that helps blur the line between instore and online experiences. I&rsquo;m looking forward to finding out a little more about this as the concept store rolls out&hellip;</p>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[World's first smartest socks with RFID technology]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Smarter Socks - probably the smartest socks in the world</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/never-lose-a-sock-again-with-blacksocks-rfid-chipped-smarter-socks/">http://www.ecouterre.com/never-lose-a-sock-again-with-blacksocks-rfid-chipped-smarter-socks/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blacksocks.com/en-us/news/newsdetailus1/newsmartersocks_us.htm">http://www.blacksocks.com/en-us/news/newsdetailus1/newsmartersocks_us.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The interaction between the socks with a <strong>communication button</strong>, the Sock Sorter and an<strong> iPhone app</strong>, makes sorting socks child's play.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How it works?</strong></h2>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<p>Imagine your phone could communicate with your socks. Your phone would know:</p>
<ul>
<li>which socks belong together,</li>
<li>and could help sort them out,</li>
<li>how often you have washed your socks,</li>
<li>when your socks were produced,</li>
<li>when you ordered your socks and</li>
<li>when your socks were dispatched.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your iPhone can also tell you if your black socks are no longer properly black and help you buy new socks.</p>
<p>This is something we dreamed about and we have made the dream come true. The result is Smarter Socks - probably the smartest socks in the world. They are undoubtedly the first socks which leave their mark on the internet via the Sock Sorter and your iPhone.</p>
</td>

</table>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p>For socks, as in real life, only those things that go together really belong together. If you have ever sorted socks, youknow it is not that easy to find the right and left socks that go together after the wash. Samy Liechti, founder and managing director of Blacksocks SA, has addressed this problem. He is convinced that mankind is made for greater things than sorting socks and has launched &ldquo;Smarter Socks&rdquo;, probably the smartest socks in the world. The interaction between the iPhone app and the elegant communication button at calf level turns the socks into a digital experience. &ldquo;Smarter Socks&rdquo; not only help with sorting after the wash, they also record the life story of every single sock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.blacksocks.com/data/images/database/$default/Screenshots_App/iPhone/Sorting_Start_EN.png" alt="Sorting Plus+ socks" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://www.blacksocks.com/data/images/database/$default/Screenshots_App/iPhone/Sorter_Web.png" alt="Sock Sorter" /></p>
<p>As the iPhone is not yet RFID-compliant, Blacksocks has invented the Sock-Sorter. Step 1: Hold the Sock-Sorter over the communication button on the sock; Step 2: Use the Sock-Sorter to scan your washing basket for the matching sock; Step 3: The iPhone makes a sound to indicate when the matching sock has been found. If two single socks want to form a new partnership, the communication button can simply be reprogrammed so everyone - even the internet - knows that a new chapter of their life has begun.&nbsp;</p>

<div>But that is not all the Blacksocks&nbsp;app can do. If you want to know if your socks of choice are midnight black or just foggy grey, you can use the BLACKSOCKS app and the iPhone camera to take a black reading. A traffic light system appears on the screen to make clear whether the socks are still wearable (or bearable). The BLACKSOCKS app is now available for free download from the App Store and the blackometer can even be used for socks from other brands.</div>

    <title><![CDATA[Digits - Conductive Glove Pins]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h4 class="prodheader">...not just for iPhone!</h4>
<p><strong>Oh, Winter</strong>. We really wish you'd go away, but you come back every year. Snowing on us. Wintry mixing on us. So we're out in the cold, scraping the ice off our cars and of course, our phone rings. Then the following sequence of events happens:</p>
<p>1. Stare at phone.</p>
<p>2. Swipe at screen with gloved hand, out of reflex.</p>
<p>3. Say words Mother doesn't appreciate.</p>
<p>4. Attempt to hold phone with one hand while removing glove from opposite hand with teeth.</p>
<p>5. Repeat step 3 when the call goes to voicemail because you took too long.</p>
<p>Don't let your gloves keep you away from your smartphone! Digits are mini conductive pins that convert the gloves you already own and love into smartphone-compatible gloves. They're made of conductive silicone with a metal pin on the back for attaching to your glove. They're super easy to install and each set comes with four pins so you can either have four fingers on one set of gloves, or two fingers each on two pairs of gloves.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/e76e/images/8627/"><img class="right" src="http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/other/e76e_iphone_digits_inuse_embed.jpg" alt="iPhone Cold" /></a></p>
<div id="bullets">
<p><strong>Product Specifications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ugly gloves NOT included</li>
<li>Convert your gloves into smartphone-compatible gloves!</li>
<li>Conductive silicone pads allow you to use your touchscreen</li>
<li>Easy To Use:

<li>Twist the other side of the Digit onto the post.</li>
<li>Attach Digits to as many fingers on the gloves as desired.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set of four Digits per package</li>
<li>Compatible with most touchscreen devices: iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Android phones, etc.</li>

    <title><![CDATA[Bionic Mannequins Spy on Window Shoppers to Boost Sales]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Store mannequins are meant to catch your eye. Now you may catch theirs.</strong></h2>
<p>Benetton brand will display&nbsp;mannequins equipped&nbsp;with hidden cameras&nbsp;in some of its stores windows to monitor and study its customers.&nbsp;These&nbsp;<strong>bionic mannequins</strong>&nbsp;spy called&nbsp;<strong>"the EyeSee"</strong>&nbsp;cost&nbsp;4000 euros each&nbsp;($5,072)&nbsp;and&nbsp;are sold&nbsp;by an Italian company, mannequin maker<a href="http://www.almax-italy.it/" target="_blank"> Almax SpA</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8203636946_f5474dc623_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>You wouldn&rsquo;t expect a mannequin to be observing you</strong></h2>
<p>The EyeSee&nbsp;<strong>looks like a regular mannequin</strong>&nbsp;form on the outside, with its glossy plastic frame, poker face and static pose. Inside, a&nbsp;<strong>camera embedded in one eye</strong>&nbsp;feeds data into&nbsp;a facial recognition software, similar to those used in airports to determine the gender, age or ethnicity of clients who would stop in front of a shop window. The objective is to&nbsp;<strong>adapt the windows and offers to boost sales</strong>.&nbsp;To update the EyeSee technology, Almax is testing a software that recognizes words to allow retailers to spy on what shoppers say about the garments displayed in the windows. The Italian company also plans to add screens next to the mannequins to suggest&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;products to shoppers according to their profile.</p>
<h2><strong>This technology raises legal and ethical issues</strong></h2>
<p>U.S.A and European Union regulations authorize the use of cameras for security purposes, but watching and profiling people for commercial benefit&nbsp;raises legal and ethical issues. the whole process could be viewed as&nbsp;<strong>gathering personal data without consent,</strong>&nbsp;though retailers need to put up signs in their stores&nbsp;<strong>warning customers</strong>&nbsp;they may be filmed.&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;Almax SpA&nbsp;said "Since the EyeSee doesn&rsquo;t store any images, retailers can use it as long as they have a closed-circuit television license.&nbsp;So far Almax hasn&rsquo;t faced obstacles to selling the spy mannequin".&nbsp;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Benetton declined&nbsp;give more information on where these models will be tested.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Twitting Dress ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2>The Printing Dress: The dress that fashionably displays tweets</h2>
<p>Made by&nbsp;<strong>Sheridan Martin Small and Asta Roseway</strong> from&nbsp;Microsoft Corporation - Microsoft Research, the "Printing Dress" is composed of three distinct parts,&nbsp;the top bodice, corset and skirt&nbsp;<strong>machine-stitched&nbsp;together. </strong>This&nbsp;dress&nbsp;was designed to be <strong>anything but subtle&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;to <strong>evokes the past</strong>.&nbsp;The most technical and&nbsp;complex of the pieces, the corset, contains <strong>thirty custom-made keys</strong>, which are assembled into a QWERTY keyboard layout.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8064/8204362914_14615d4e3e_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>The &ldquo;Printing Dress&rdquo; symbolizes the evolutionary phases of communication (past,&nbsp;present, and future) and their impact on society. </strong></h2>
<p>Definitly futuristic but inspired by technologies of the past,&nbsp;the designers&nbsp;Roseway and Small&nbsp;intentionally designed the style of the dress to reflect on the monochromatic&nbsp;origins of printing and type.&nbsp;To reflect the ubiquity of texting on the go, Roseway and Small&nbsp;integrated a custom keyboard designed like a vintage typewriter, that allows the wearer to send Twitter 140 characters message, which is then displayed on the dress&nbsp;through a projector.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8478/8203271021_3fe9ae1ef8_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>The dress is built with&nbsp;<em>LilyPad Arduino</em>&nbsp;boards, USB hub, a laptop, a capacitive keyboard, wire, and a short-throw projector</strong></h2>
<p>Featuring <strong>latest wearable technology</strong>, the dress displays four&nbsp;<a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/massimo-banzi-how-arduino-is-open-sourcing-imagination" target="_blank">LilyPad Arduino</a>&nbsp;boards, an USB hub, a laptop, a capacitive keyboard, solid and stranded wire, and a short-throw projector. Hitting a key sends it to the laptop, which then displays the 140 character as<strong> animated text</strong>.&nbsp;&ldquo;Some may be repelled by its ostentatious presentation, while others might dare to imagine a more transparent and open world,&rdquo; say the designers. &ldquo;It is our hope that this piece will inspire conversations that go <strong>beyond&nbsp;fashion or technology</strong>&nbsp;to topics such as awareness, accountability, privacy, and identity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Everpurse - The Purse That Magically Charges Your Phone All Day]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Everpurse: A Bag That Wirelessly Charges Your Smartphone All Day</strong></h2>
<p>Designed by&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;Elizabeth Ormesher Salcedo,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://everpurse.com/" target="_blank">Everpurse</a> is a handbag that will charge your phone from 0% to 100% approximately twice in one day. The purse comes with a&nbsp;charging mat to charge Everpurse itself. To charge the purse, you just have to place it on its mat. The simple and genius technology uses inductive charging to send energy wirelessly from the mat to the purse, so you never have to plug the purse in. You can leave a charging mat plugged in wherever it's convenient and drop your purse onto it when it needs charging.&nbsp;(And you can even leave your phone in the purse while it's on its charging mat for more charging power!)</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8063/8204954122_b8e8cfda59_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Just drop the phone in the pocket and it starts charging</strong></h2>
<p><strong>You won't need a special case</strong>&nbsp;or modifications for this handbag to work with your phone. Just drop the phone in the pocket and it starts charging. The patent-pending docking system physically connects to the phone to start charging and the&nbsp;Everpurse has a special charging pocket were you drop your phone into. The patent-pending docking system will&nbsp;smoothly&nbsp;guide your phone onto a dock connector at the bottom&mdash;so you don't have to fish for a cord!No need to worry if you spill something inside your bag as all the technology is safely encased behind the lining.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[NASA’s “Iron Man” Robotic Suit Could Help Paraplegics Walk]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>What do Ironman, astronauts on a mission to Mars and paraplegics have in common?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><em>"In Marvel Comic's fictional superhero,&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man" target="_blank">Ironman</a></strong>, uses a powered armor suit that allows him superhuman strength.&nbsp;While NASA's X1 robotic exoskeleton can't do what you see in the movies, the latest robotic, space technology, spinoff derived from NASA's Robonaut 2 project may someday help astronauts stay healthier in space with the added benefit of assisting paraplegics in walking here on Earth."</em></p>
<p><strong>X1</strong>&nbsp;is a a&nbsp;<strong>robotic exoskeleton</strong>&nbsp;and a joint project by NASA and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ihmc.us/">The Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition</a>&nbsp;(IHMC) of Pensacola, with help from engineers from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oceaneering.com/">Oceaneering Space Systems</a>&nbsp;in Houston.<br />The 57-pound (25.85 kg) device is&nbsp;<strong>a robot that a human could wear</strong>&nbsp;over its legs by means of a harness over the back and shoulders and consists of four motorized joints at the hips and knees with ten degrees of freedom and six passive joints for turning and flexing the foot.&nbsp;The device can be used either to&nbsp;<strong>assist or inhibit movement</strong>&nbsp;in leg joints.&nbsp;In the inhibit mode, the robotic device would be&nbsp;<strong>used as an in-space exercise machine</strong>&nbsp;to supply resistance against leg movement. The same technology could be used in reverse on the ground, potentially&nbsp;<strong>helping people to walk again.</strong></p>

<p><em>Project Engineer Roger Rovekamp demonstrates the X1 Robotic Exoskeleton for resistive exercise, rehabilitation and mobility augmentation in the Advanced Robotics Development Lab.</em><br /><em>Image courtesy of Robert Markowitz</em></p>
<h2><strong>Though it may not be evident, astronauts on extended missions in zero gravity and paraplegics face similar issues: muscle atrophy through lack of use</strong></h2>
<p>If the suit can serve as&nbsp;<strong>an exercise device aboard space stations</strong>&nbsp;without taking up too much space or weight, IHMC is investigating the use of the X1 as an&nbsp;<strong>assistive walking device</strong>&nbsp;that could be used for paraplegics. &ldquo;Robotics is playing a key role aboard the International Space Station and will continue to be critical as we move toward human exploration of deep space,&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>Michael Gazarik, director of<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/index.html" target="_blank">&nbsp;NASA&rsquo;s&nbsp;</a></strong><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Space Technology Program</strong>,</a>&nbsp;says. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s extraordinary about space technology and our work with projects like Robonaut are the&nbsp;<strong>unexpected possibilities space-tech spinoffs may have right here on Earth</strong>. It&rsquo;s exciting to see a NASA-developed technology that might one day help people with serious ambulatory needs begin to walk again, or even walk for the first time. That&rsquo;s the sort of return on investment NASA is proud to give back to America and the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Currently in the development phase, researchers are still improving the design of the X1 and are working to add more active joints at the ankle and hip&nbsp;which will, in turn, increase the potential uses for the device.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[BANDU: The Watch That Gives You Time to Relax]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h1 class="bold x-large notranslate">bandu: The watch that gives you time to relax</h1>
<p><span>bandu is a biofeedback watch and smartphone app that gives you time to reduce stress with music, games, a phone call, meditation or even a simple stretch.</span></p>
<h2><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>bandu by Neumitra</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>The brain is a muscle like any other. Willpower is a resource that gets depleted over the course of the day. The stress of our daily commutes, personal relationships, and work demands prevent us from being at our most productive.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>That's why we developed&nbsp;<strong>bandu,&nbsp;</strong>a watch that gives you time to slow down, take a moment, and prepare your best efforts. Built by a neuroscientist and engineers, bandu alerts you to listen to music, play a game, call a friend, meditate or stretch. We show you what works to reduce your stress.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/03/demo-gods-birds-brains-and-the-best-products-of-the-season/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">bandu is a named a God at DEMO 2012!</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How bandu works</strong></h2>
<p>bandu measures the autonomic nervous system, which is associated with the effects of stress including perspiration, respiration, and cardiology.&nbsp;The current version monitors your skin conductance, movement, and temperature.&nbsp;When you become stressed, bandu alerts to you to take a break. You can listen to a favorite song or play a fun game. You can even call a trusted friend, just stand up to stretch or even meditate. The results are shown right on your smartphone in real-time so you can monitor your stress level, see when it rises, and determine the people, places, and things that help you feel better.&nbsp;And over time, bandu automatically learns what works.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h2><strong>Our Smartphone App</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
<p>We've been working hard to build bandu over the last three years after meeting in a class at MIT. We realized that despite all of the technologies available for biofeedback, none alert you to the need to find peace and quiet in small moments of your daily life. We're now participating in two accelerators<a href="http://www.rockhealth.com/" rel="nofollow">RockHealth</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;Harvard Medical School and&nbsp;<a href="http://masschallenge.org/" rel="nofollow">MassChallenge</a>&nbsp;to bring bandu to your wrist.</p>
<h2><strong>The role of stress on life, work, and play</strong></h2>
<div>Stress is a survival instinct. When something feels like life or death - a big test, a major presentation, a costly game - that's how your body is feeling. And during those moments it's difficult to think straight. Stress affects your short-term memory, your long-term memory, and your attention. We know that stress can also become a medical problem and makes symptom worse for conditions as varied as post-traumatic stress, panic disorder, heart disease, asthma, irritible bowel syndrome, even fertility.</div>

<p><strong><em>Medgadget</em>:<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>Your first product is the bandu, correct? What does it do and how does it work? Where did its name come from?</p>
<p><strong>Goldberg:&nbsp;</strong>bandu is designed as the first effort to measure the autonomic nervous system as part of your daily life. We found that as compelling as the data is for us, users wanted something more.&nbsp;So we built in the watch face to alert you during your most stressful times and trigger apps on your phone to help you to feel better and show what works for you, your friends, and across larger groups.</p>
<p>bandu is from the Sanskrit &ldquo;bandhu&rdquo; meaning friend or buddy. We see bandu as a living, learning buddy for your daily life. The AI is designed to get smarter the more to wear it to better alert you to impending changes in your stress and with the best apps to help&nbsp;support you. Your data allows us to understand and effect stress more broadly across your life, your friends, even your whole company and city.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[ Victorinox Swiss Army Night Vision Watch]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p><a class="txtlarge gl3 gr4 reviewTitle valignMiddle" href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E6FHV1GIRZHS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B0055QEC5I&amp;channel=detail-glance&amp;nodeID=3375251&amp;store=watches"><strong>High quality watch with great utility light</strong></a></p>
<p><span>A Swiss styled<strong> stainless steel quartz watch</strong> for those who wish to have an adventurous look with executive personality, Victorinox Night Vision Watch is designed to light up the night vision with just a push button. That&rsquo;s not all; pushing the control button 3 times, activates the emergency strobe mode therefore, flashing quickly for up to seven days. Another LED is available in the front to illuminate the face of the watch. The Swiss made stainless steel watch is entirely scratch resistant, triple coated anti-reflective sapphire crystal providing an unassuming experience. Victorinox Night Vision Watch is the perfectly fine gift on Christmas Eve.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;the blue light on the face is very readable at night and the little mini flashlight built in the bezel comes in handy when you least expect it. Like when you're crawling under a desk looking for a loose screw, or making a midnight trip to the bathroom in a strange hotel room.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Bright enough to navigate a dark room at night or read in a tent...battery life is the big unknown</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The dial is easy to read and the little blue LED on the face that activates when you push the single button makes it easy to get to see in the dark. The white LED at the top of the watch (activate by double-tapping the button) is the killer feature. How many times have you fumbled for keys in the dark or tried to find a lightswitch? It's surprisingly bright.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Marks & Spencer Uses Enzyme Technology to Keep Uniforms Looking Like New Longer]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Enzymes added to the clothes during the textile production allowed the garments to last longer</strong></h2>
<p>Kids usually don't take care of their clothes. maybe more especially when the clothes we are talking about are school uniforms they have to wear day in and day out. Searching for a solution&nbsp;Marks &amp; Spencer in a collaboration with&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.novozymes.com/en/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Novozymes</a></strong>, has developed&nbsp;<strong>sustainable enzymes,&nbsp;</strong>the "Stay NewTM technology".&nbsp;The process is quite simple: the enzymes are adding to the clothes during the textile production helping the garments to be stronger right from the get-go.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8246058376_dbb151d33f_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>The whole process production&nbsp;saves water<a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/swedish-student-turns-toxic-textile-effluent-into-clean-dye-free-water/" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a>and reduces energy during production</strong></h2>
<p>This new&nbsp;technology is also<strong>&nbsp;surfing on the&nbsp;"green wave"</strong>&nbsp;but is also a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/marks-spencer-pledges-to-eliminate-toxic-chemicals-from-clothing/" target="_blank">part of their goal</a>&nbsp;to become the most sustainable retailer by 2015.&nbsp;Since the&nbsp;<em>Stay NewTM technology</em>&nbsp;enzymes are added during the bleaching and dying process, the whole process&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/swedish-student-turns-toxic-textile-effluent-into-clean-dye-free-water/" target="_blank">saves water&nbsp;</a>and reduces energy during production. At the end, it&nbsp;should dramatically decrease costs, not to mention the "add value"&nbsp;for their customers,&nbsp;the&nbsp;consolidation of their&nbsp;<strong>favourable public opinion</strong>,&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Brainwave-Sensing Headband Lets Your Control Things With Your Mind]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h1>A "Brainwave-Reading Headband" that Tracks Your Mood</h1>
<p class="intro"><strong>It&rsquo;s like a mood ring, but for your forehead.</strong></p>
<p>a Canadian company called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.interaxon.ca/">InteraXon</a>, which is running an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/interaxonmuse?c=activity">Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign</a>&nbsp;to get the project off the ground. They&rsquo;re calling the headband the &ldquo;Muse&rdquo; and describing it as a chic brainwave reader for your forehead.</p>
<p>With its curved ends tucked behind your ears, the Muse is meant to track your moods, picking up indications of focus and concentration or stress, InteraXon claims. It&rsquo;s slightly less conspicuous than the cat ears, don&rsquo;t you agree?</p>
<p>The headband is supposed to work like a portable electroencephalograph, the company explains on its website, picking up signals in the brain generated by the electrical pings of firing neurons. InteraXon says it&rsquo;s developed algorithms that glean shifts in patterns indicating stress, focus, and relaxation from the tangled mix of electromagnetic signals that the Muse band registers.</p>
<p>Bluetooth-savvy, the Muse transmits the data it&rsquo;s picking up to a smartphone app, which visually depicts the ticking in your brain. (Or so the company says&mdash;having never tested one myself, I only have YouTube videos for proof.)</p>
<p>To be clear, the Muse isn&rsquo;t designed to read your thoughts. &ldquo;You can think of it like a heart-rate monitor for your brain,&rdquo; InteraXon cofounder&nbsp;<a href="http://www.interaxon.ca/bios">Trevor Colemen</a>&nbsp;explained during an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1208xh/iama_cofounder_of_interaxon_a_toronto_company/">Ask Me Anything session on Reddit</a>&nbsp;recently. &ldquo;With a heart rate monitor, you can tell how active someone is, but not what sport they&rsquo;re playing. In the same way, we can detect levels of activity, but not what specifically you&rsquo;re thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The execs at InteraXon hope that the Muse will be used for more than just mental calisthenics, and that it will interface meaningfully with apps on your computer and phone. Which is kind of similar to the Mindwave Mobile Brainwave headset that lets you play hands-free games on your phone using only the headset and, well, your mind. When&nbsp;<em>Wired</em>&rsquo;s Christina Bonnington&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/05/mindwave-mobile-hands-on/">reviewed that device</a>&nbsp;she wrote: &ldquo;Yes, the technology does work. It&rsquo;s just not very fun.&rdquo; Also: &ldquo;You look like a dork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To let developers in on the fun and mind games, InteraXon is planning an SDK launch early next year. But one application already exists. In an early moment of inspiration, InteraXon built what it describes as a &ldquo;thought-controlled beer tap&rdquo; demoed at events in the past. (In this application, you&rsquo;re supposed to be able to open and shut the tap on a keg of beer just by thinking about it.)</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s core technology was developed at electrical engineer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~mann/">Steve Mann</a>&rsquo;s lab at the University of Toronto. Mann founded the company and remains on the board as an advisor. (Mann was also the bespectacled tourist who earned himself a news moment as the&nbsp;<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/one-on-one-steve-mann-wearable-computing-pioneer/">cyborg</a>scientist&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/07/18/steve_mann_s_eyetap_was_an_assault_at_a_paris_mcdonald_s_the_first_cybernetic_hate_crime_.html">attacked at a Parisian McDonald&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;on account of his&nbsp;<a href="http://eyetap.org/">extraordinary headgear</a>.)</p>
<p>InteraXon hopes to raise $150,000 through its Indiegogo campaign by December 7 this year. At last count, contributors had chipped in a little over $51,000, and 200 of those had thrown in $135, the amount that gets you rewarded with a free headband, app, and access to the SDK at a discounted rate. A go at the thought-controlled beer tap is a second perk (an expensive one, be warned), as is a T-shirt with your brainwaves custom-patterned on it. After all, what else could you possibly want to wear if you have a mind-reading headband plastered to your forehead?</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Macy's Exclusive Video Sweater]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>A men&rsquo;s sweater equipped with a personal video screen, on the left sleeve</strong></h2>
<p>Clothing brand Sean John &nbsp;(rapper, record producer Puff Daddy's fashion line) and retailer Macy&rsquo;s have announced that they will be offering <strong>the world&rsquo;s first video fashion clothing</strong>. The little embedded display on the sleeve (a 2.8-inch active matrix OLED panel) comes from <a href="http://www.recomgroup.com/" target="_blank">Recom Group </a>and is called the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.videonametag.com/hardwarespecifications.html" target="_blank">Video Name Tag</a>.&nbsp;With a resolution of just 320x240 and 2 GB of storage, and a 2.8-inch display. On a full charge the internal lithium-ion battery allows you to play videos or run slideshows continuously for 6 to 10 hours. The modernism has its limits, note the display has to be removed for cleaning the sweater!</p>
<h2><strong>Brilliant idea or Flagrant lack of taste?</strong></h2>
<p>The shawl-collared sweaters&nbsp;will be available around the USA&nbsp;in select Macy&rsquo;s stores from this week,&nbsp;for at an introductory <strong>promotion price of $125</strong>. Then it will be on sale at its regular pricing, $198. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is a big deal for Macy's and Sean John,&rdquo; CEO Rob Norden tells. &ldquo;It's never been done before.&rdquo; The Press Release promesses you'll get a lot of attention while clubbing. Hum... ok... Still, <strong>wouldn't it make more sense to put it more on the front?</strong> It would still be tacky, but do you really want people staring at your arm all the time?</p>
<p>If you are in the mood to show-off, click <a href="http://www.recomgroup.com/macys.htm" target="_blank">here</a> to find out if your Macy&rsquo;s is one of the locations that will be selling the video sweater.</p>

<p><span>Future garments may be highly individualized. A system from London-based Skin Graph uses motion capture and thermal scanning to create 3-D representations of the body. After the wearer's body shape is mapped, the fabric is laser-cut to ensure a comfortable fit.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future Tailoring - Couture With Personality<br /><br /><span>Skin Graph has development&nbsp;</span><span><strong>advanced 3D mapping techniques, parametric design and data-driven fabrication processes</strong></span><span>, with the focus to address the engineered neutrality of optimisation.</span><span><strong>Skin Graph questions the practice of tailoring</strong></span><span>&nbsp;and proposes operative strategies that can inscribe the personality of the individual directly into apparel.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>With the underlining philosophy; that the&nbsp;</span><span><strong>individual must have a level of integrated authorship</strong></span><span>within the design process itself to truly create the bespoke. The result being a second skin where the nature of emotion and time is recorded as resonating patterns and cuts flexing and articulated with every move of the individual.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Skin Graph technology</strong></span><span>&nbsp;encourages play as an important part of cultural evolution. The scanning process plays an major role and allows the individual to articulate&nbsp;</span><span><strong>the personification of couture</strong></span><span>through gesture posture and movement each of which is recorded and represented directly into the final material product.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Skin graph questions the practice of tailoring and poses operative strategies that can inscribe the personality of the individual directly into the garment.</span><br /><br /><img src="http://payload48.cargocollective.com/1/7/227735/3264515/parchment_lg_o.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="auto" /></span></p>
<div>We&nbsp;<span><strong>articulate our bodies through both space and time</strong></span>, this movement is fundamental to the nature of the garment.&nbsp;<span><strong>Posture = Personality</strong></span>&nbsp;a presence extending beyond the depth of our immediate skin. Skin Graph allows the&nbsp;<span><strong>individual to take control</strong></span>&nbsp;in creating their bespoke contour pattern, through articulation and expression of their desired body movements.<br /><br />Like skin the essence of time is recorded, a second skin is generated as a representation of one self. Both the physical and the emotional factors of their personality are&nbsp;<span><strong>inscribed into material</strong></span>&nbsp;the second skin can displace and resonate a&nbsp;<span><strong>mapping of memory and potentiality.</strong></span><br /><br /><span><strong>Skin graph offers a creative platform</strong></span>&nbsp;for which individuals can upload their digital entity representations through a scanning process. The&nbsp;<span><strong>3D topographical data</strong></span>&nbsp;can be manipulated through generative and<span><strong>evolutionary design techniques</strong></span>, such as parametric modelling, in the pursuit of systemic design applications that are scenario- and time-based through the&nbsp;<span><strong>physical performance of the individual.</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br /></strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><span>The Corporal Landscape offers multiple layers of potential data extraction. The interference pattern is a representation of interrelated complex data sets. The development of advanced Parametric design solutions will&nbsp;</span><span><strong>engineer the mapped data</strong></span><span>&nbsp;into the vast complexities of interrelated parameters such as material, 3D form finding and per formative requirements through derived&nbsp;</span><span><strong>mathematical algorithms.&nbsp;</strong></span><br /><br /><span>Treating the fabrication process as a formulation of language where each different stitch acts as grammar the formation of words and sentences are generated through the algorithmic programming.</span></strong></span></div>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[Vuzix’s “Smart” Sunglasses Merge Virtual Information With Real World]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<span>Integrated HD display engines and waveguide optics that literally break the boundaries of conventional optics and display solutions. For decades wearable displays have been referred to as Head Mounted Displays because of their bulky size and odd appearance; primarily attributable to the displays and conventional refractive and or reflective optics that they employ.&nbsp; This older technology is limited by the laws of optical physics that result in form factors that are large, heavy, and practically impossible to make into fashion eyewear.</span></p>
<p>Now after years of internal developments and our recent licensing relationship with Nokia Corporation, SMART Glasses Technology is finally here. This amazing new technology starts with a compact display engine capable of hi contrast and brightness for outdoor use.&nbsp; The output is then relayed into a 1.4 mm thick polymer waveguide lens with input and output hologram structures on the surface which squeezes the light down the waveguide and then two dimensionally expands the image back into the user's eye, creating an image that is then mixed into the real world.&nbsp; And, all this technology neatly fits into the temples &amp; lenses of a conventional pair of eyewear!</p>
<p>As the name implies, SMART Glasses are much more than just a wearable TV. Designed to work with SMART Devices that are typically connected to the internet, SMART Glasses are interactive and merge virtual information with the real world.&nbsp; They can be used at night or outdoors in full daylight.</p>
<p>Vuzix is planning a line of both monocular and binocular SMART Glasses for the Commercial, Industrial and Consumer markets. With integrated head tracking and options for multiple camera technologies Vuzix SMART Glasses can broaden the users' sensory perception across a greatly expanded light spectrum; additionally they can be used to recognize their environment along with their position in the real world, all-the-while recording and transmitting what the user sees.</p>
<p>From standalone solutions for night vision and first responder use to fully internet connected and geospatially aware devices for amazing Augmented Reality applications.</p>
<p>Look for Vuzix SMART Glasses technology initial release into the commercial and industrial markets by fall 2012.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/augmented-reality-sneakers-by-adidas-unlock-3-d-virtual-world/">Augmented reality</a><span>&mdash;the ability to superimpose virtual data onto real-world environments&mdash;is appealing in theory, but typical head-mounted displays have the subtlety of a sledgehammer to your forehead.&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.vuzix.com/home/">Vusix</a><span>, a video-eyewear company from Rochester, NY, has invented an electronic headset that looks&mdash;and works&mdash;like a pair of designer sunglasses. Unveiled at the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/aftershokz-bone-conducting-earphones-pumps-music-through-your-skull/">Consumer Electronics Show</a><span>&nbsp;in Las Vegas this week, the Internet-connected &ldquo;Smart&rdquo; device uses holographic film to serve interactive content right before your eyes. Besides changing the way you work and play, not to mention interact with your assorted gadgets, the Smart also has potential applications in&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/solar-powered-soldiers-to-revolutionize-australian-combat/">military ops</a><span>, emergency response, and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/messenger-dog-a-canine-equipped-digital-messaging-system-for-disaster-relief/">disaster management</a><span>.</span></p>
<h3>SUPERVISION</h3>
<p>Featuring a sleek wraparound design, the Smart can be used indoors or out, at night or in full daylight. Thanks to licensing from&nbsp;<a href="http://inhabitat.com/nokia-new-concept-phone-lets-you-re-charge-in-your-pocket/">Nokia</a>, Vuzix says the glasses are able to offer portability and visual quality while meeting the demands in mobility, thermal sighting systems, tactical wearable displays, and virtual reality.</p>
<blockquote>Featuring a sleek wraparound design, the Smart can be used indoors or out, at night or in full daylight.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The technology comprises a compact display engine that relays any digital output by shunting wavelengths of light onto a 1.4-millimeter-thick polymer lens. It then expands the image back into the eye, creating an image that mixes the virtual with what you see before you in real life. &ldquo;Smart glasses technology is much more than just a wearable TV,&rdquo; the company says in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vuzix-announces-plans-for-smart-glasses-technology---holy-grail-of-wearable-display-industry-see-through-hd-glasses-in-a-designer-sunglasses-form-factor---at-ces-2012-136823038.html">a press release</a>. &ldquo;Designed to work with smart devices that are typically connected to the Internet, Smart glasses are interactive and merge virtual information with the real world.&rdquo;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[3D Printed Shoe by Marieka Ratsma and Kostika Spaho]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Biomimicry Shoe by Marieka Ratsma&nbsp;and Kostika Spaho</strong></h2>
<p><span>Those <strong>3D-printed shoes</strong> were designed by Dutch fashion designer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mariekaratsma.nl/" target="_blank">Marieka Ratsma</a>&nbsp;and American architect&nbsp;<a href="http://archinect.com/people/cover/25742536/kostika-spaho" target="_blank">Kostika Spaho</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8199/8247500247_1e7abaa3f8.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Organic inspiration</strong></h2>
<p>The curious and scuptural hollow heel&nbsp;was inspired by&nbsp;bird&rsquo;s skull&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8205/8248568848_66ae3579ac_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Lightweight structure&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>The delicate and hollowed structure that almost looks like lace allowed the shoe to be 3D-printed using less material.</p>

<h2><strong>Scuptural design</strong></h2>
<p>Creators&nbsp;Ratsma and Spaho used the shape of a bird&rsquo;s beak to design the spike of&nbsp;the heel.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[FashionLab European Press Trip]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p><strong>FashionLab was recently launched in Sweden, in the Netherlands and in Germany, via some press conferences.</strong></p>
<p>After the UK and Italy beginning of the year, we continued our press trip in Stockholm, at our PR agency&rsquo;s - AxiCom.</p>
<p><a id="yui_3_7_3_3_1355250906922_764" class="rapidnofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79884939@N02/8264036319/in/photostream" data-track="photo-click" data-rapid_p="10"><img id="yui_3_7_3_3_1355250906922_763" class="pc_img" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8496/8264036319_e4638c0a03_m.jpg" alt="IMG_1776" width="240" height="180" border="0" data-thumbdata="" /></a></p>
<p>Then we did a press conference in Amsterdam, in a very nice place named &lsquo;Cool Brands house&rsquo;. Very trendy and smart!</p>
<p>Last but not least we launched the FashionLab in Germany, in Frankfurt, where Julien Fourni&eacute; attended to give a testimony.</p>
<p>Thanks to these press activities we have been very present in the media in Europe. We have created our <strong><a href="http://www.scoop.it/t/fashionlab" target="_blank">scoop.it</a></strong> account almost one year ago where you could read FashionLab related articles.</p>
<p><a id="yui_3_7_3_3_1355250906922_784" class="rapidnofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79884939@N02/8265113958/in/photostream" data-track="photo-click" data-rapid_p="2"><img id="yui_3_7_3_3_1355250906922_783" class="pc_img" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8490/8265113958_b7f10218d0_m.jpg" alt="articles" width="240" height="149" border="0" data-thumbdata="" /></a></p>
<p>In parallel we did many events, we attended and speak at different conferences in Paris, but also in Europe and in the US.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s next?</strong></p>
<p>The FashionLab was officially launched last year in November 2011 in NYC, and since then, we traveled in London, Milan, Stockholm, Amsterdam, Frankfurt for press activities and also in Paris, Brussels, in the US, and not so long ago in Singapour for the Fashion week&hellip; But that was just a beginning!</p>
<p>FashionLab will be this week in Prague for another Press conference! We will be welcomed by Galerie/CZD, ran by Czechdesign magazine. And we are also preparing our 2013 activities&hellip;</p>
<p>So, stay tuned!</p>]]></body>

    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>WOVEN&nbsp;break down the ever softening boundaries between the virtual and the&nbsp;<em>physical</em>&nbsp;real world.</strong></h2>
<p>Deutch Designer&nbsp;<strong>Patrick Kersten</strong> and Game Designer&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.fashioningtech.com/profiles/blogs/Christiaan%20Ribbens">Christiaan Ribbens</a></strong>&nbsp;both Masters students at HKU the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.hku.nl/web/English/English/UtrechtSchoolOfTheArts.htm" target="_blank">Utrecht School of the Arts</a></strong>, created an&nbsp;<strong>wearable tech gaming platform</strong>&nbsp;named&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://wearablegames.eu/platform/" target="_blank">Woven</a>.&nbsp;</strong>This project was part of the studies&nbsp;<strong>Game Design &amp; Development and Interaction Design.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8491/8267750795_31ebf1508c_c.jpg" alt="" /></strong></p>
<h2><strong>A sweater and a pair of jean loaded with technology</strong></h2>
<p>The E-wearable gaming platform&nbsp;consists of a sweater and a pair of jeans.&nbsp;The heart of the woven are the <strong>three Arduino Lilypad boards.</strong>&nbsp;Speakers, shake motors,&nbsp;and a LiPo battery completed the tech outfit. The plateform&nbsp;is connected via bluetooth to a mobile phone which runs an app, controlling <strong>bend sensors and heart rate sensors and a 144 RGB LED display.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h2><strong>A game that blurr the interaction between the digital and physical life</strong></h2>
<p>To demonstrate the potential and wide variety of uses of the e-Wearable platform, the two designers worked with experts to create<strong>&nbsp;a game named Spooky</strong>&nbsp;that&nbsp;lets the player experience the world of ghosts, and&nbsp;can only be played using the WOVEN, blurring the<strong>&nbsp;interaction between the digital and physical life</strong>.&nbsp;The game uses gamer body and heart rate and gives auditory and haptic feedback...</p>

    <title><![CDATA[AnyGlove - Use Your Touchscreen Phone While Wearing Gloves]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>A true revolution in touchscreen glove technology that is 100% Made In The USA</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a class="external" href="http://anyglove.com/" target="_blank">AnyGlove</a></strong>&nbsp;is a <strong>magic liquid</strong>...&nbsp;when applied to the tips of your gloves it allows them to work on touchscreens. It&nbsp;will work perfectly with any iPhone, Android or other touchscreen-enabled screen. For just&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/AnyGloveTM-Almost-Gloves-Touchscreen-Texting/dp/tech-data/B00AB3EVOW/ref=de_a_smtd" target="_blank">$15 a bottle</a></strong>&nbsp;(that can&nbsp;treat multiple pairs)&nbsp;this sounds like <strong>the solution we&rsquo;ve been looking for a long time</strong>. I mean at least since the iPhone 1st generation's time...</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8339/8283021692_0d96de72fe_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Never again we will endure the shame of&nbsp;using our frozen nose to answer the phone!</strong></h2>
<p>All you have to do is apply<strong>&nbsp;a few drops of the liquid to the tips of the gloves</strong>&nbsp;of your choice.&nbsp;While it's not a permanent treatment, the liquid doesn't wash off, and the "second skin" <strong>functionality can lasts for weeks or months</strong>, depending on the type of gloves and how they are used. The product is not recommended for light-colored gloves since they could be stained by the liquid. However, there is no problem on&nbsp;darker colors and the liquid&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>virtually invisible</strong>.&nbsp;Never again we will suffer of having to take our gloves off or&nbsp;endure the shame of&nbsp;using our nose to answer the phone!</p>]]></body>

<p><span class="font-size-2">Mixing&nbsp;conventional and innovative materials and techniques,&nbsp;Australian designer&nbsp;<strong>Amelia Agosta</strong>&nbsp;</span>graduated recently from the Melbourn&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au/">RMIT University</a></strong>, used technology and using digital tools&nbsp;wisely to create her final year collection <strong>"Engineered Distortion".</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8362/8292096401_5e5d641497_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong><em>Engineered Distortion</em>&nbsp;fuses together craft and technology</strong></h2>
<p>Asked to described her collection, she says :&nbsp;<span>&ldquo;<em>Engineered Distortion</em> fuses together craft and technology. Informed by the architectural style deconstructivism, the collection maintains <strong>intricate pattern making and traditional tailoring</strong> techniques through sculptural forms, distorted shapes and hard and soft materials.<strong> 3D body scanning and 3D printing technologie</strong>s are instrumental in articulating sculpted forms composed of repetitive lines and geometries that wrap around the female body."</span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Apple and Intel Bluetooth Smart Watch]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Rumor has it :&nbsp;</strong>Apple and Intel could launch a Bluetooth Smart Watch during the first half of 2013&nbsp;</h2>
<p>"Website&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://iphone.tgbus.com/news/class/201212/20121226172410.shtml" target="_blank"><em>TGBus</em>&nbsp;reports</a>&nbsp;</strong>(translation via&nbsp;<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://mobilegeeks.de/apple-und-intel-arbeiten-zusammen-an-bluetooth-smart-watch-fuer-2013/&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank"><em>Mobilegeeks.de</em></a>)&nbsp;that <strong>Apple and Intel are currently working together</strong> on a Bluetooth-enabled smart watch. According to the Chinese website, the watch should featured a 1.5-inch OLED display from RITEK subsidiary RiTdisplay and could be launched in the first half of 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Apple's Siri voice assistant should allow users to take phone calls directly through the watch</strong></h2>
<p>Smart&nbsp;Apple's watch full details are still unknown, but TGBus compares Apple's project to Sony's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/us/products/accessories/smartwatch/" target="_blank">SmartWatch</a>. The report highlights&nbsp;Apple's Siri voice assistant could provide a <strong>dramatic upgrade in the smart watch market</strong> since its integration with the iPhone should allow users to take phone calls directly through the watch.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[The 1st Flexible Fiber-Optic Solar Cell that Can Be Woven Into Clothes]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<div id="recommended-popup">
<h2><strong>A solar fabric that will be&nbsp;capable of converting solar radiation into direct-current electricity</strong></h2>
<p>An international team of scientists have developed <strong>the world&rsquo;s first flexible fiber-optic solar cell</strong>. The&nbsp;silicon-based&nbsp;fibers are&nbsp;thinner than an average human hair, flexible and have been conceived to be scalable to many meters in length.&nbsp;Many attempts have been made in the past to integrate&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/diffus-chic-solar-power-bag-flaunts-its-photovoltaic-panels-instead-of-hiding-them/" target="_blank">photovoltaic technology</a></strong>&nbsp;into flexible fabrics but average components were too rigid and unyielding.&nbsp;The research, led by&nbsp;<strong>John Badding</strong>, a professor of chemistry at&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://live.psu.edu/story/63020" target="_blank">Pennsylvania State University</a></strong>&nbsp;opens the door to the possibility of weaving together solar-cell silicon wires to create flexible, curved, or twisted solar fabrics that will be&nbsp;capable of converting solar radiation into direct-current electricity.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to extend high-performance electronic and solar-cell function to longer lengths and to more flexible forms. We already have made meters-long fibers but, in principle, our team's new method could be used to create bendable silicon solar-cell fibers of over 10 meters in length," Badding said. "Long, fiber-based solar cells give us&nbsp;<strong>the potential to do something we couldn't really do before</strong>: We can take the silicon fibers and weave them together into a fabric with a wide range of applications such as power generation, battery charging, chemical sensing, and biomedical devices."</p>

</div>
<h2><strong>One of the major limitations of portable electronics is&nbsp;short battery life. Solar-boosted batteries could help solve this problem</strong></h2>
<p>Badding explained&nbsp;"A solar cell is usually made from a glass or plastic substrate onto which hydrogenated amorphous silicon has been grown, such a solar cell is created using an expensive piece of equipment called a PECVD reactor and the end result is something flat with little flexibility. But woven,&nbsp;<strong>fiber-based solar cells would be lightweight, flexible configurations that are portable, foldable, and even wearable</strong>." This material could then be connected to electronic devices to power them and charge their batteries. "The military especially is interested in designing wearable power sources for soldiers in the field," Badding added.</p>
<h2><strong>The flexibility of the&nbsp;Fiber-Optic Solar Cell&nbsp;allows to&nbsp;collect light energy at different angles</strong></h2>
<p>The Badding's team members also believe that another advantage of flexibility of their materials is the&nbsp;<strong>possibility of collecting light energy at different angles</strong>. "A typical solar cell has only one flat surface," Badding says. "But a flexible, curved solar-cell fabric would not be as dependent upon where the light is coming from or where the sun is in the horizon and the time of day."</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Skinsucka - A Design Provocation]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>A project that explores and questions our attitudes to&nbsp;hyper consumerism&nbsp;robotics and bio-technology</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.studio-xo.com/" target="_blank">Studio XO</a>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;fashion and technology company that&nbsp;<strong>creates and engineers interactive wearable experiences</strong>. They are well known for their very provocative work for clients including Philips Lighting, Philips Design, Universal Music, ITV, EMI, Tord Brontje and many others.&nbsp;This project, a 4 minutes film named&nbsp;<a href="http://www.studio-xo.com/work.php/47/skin-sucka" target="_blank">Skinsucka</a>,&nbsp;is more than a design provocation. <strong>It draws attention to "hyper consumerism that blinds us</strong> to the exploitative forces that make it possible to produce a garment in Asia, ship it halfway around the world to a high street in Europe, for less than the cost of junk food". It also&nbsp;explores and questions our attitudes to robotics and bio-technology in a timeframe of 1 to 2 decades from now. &nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Raf Simons’ 1st Ad Campaign for Dior Revealed]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2 class="h1"><strong>Designer Raf Simons Goes Surreal For His First Dior Ad Campaign&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<div class="content line">
<p>The first Dior ready-to-wear ad campaign under the direction of Raf Simons has&nbsp;<strong>surrealist influence of Belgian painter Ren&eacute; Magritte</strong>. Shot by Willy Vanderperre, another Belgian, and Simon&rsquo;s long date collaborator, the campaign pictures are far away from the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://fashiongonerogue.com/dior-fall-2010-campaign-preview-karlie-kloss-steven-meisel/" target="_blank">provocative style of John Galliano</a></span></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8501/8356264016_173670ac04_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>The Campaign splits the fashion Dior addicts opinion</strong></h2>
<p>No more famous super star top model like<strong> Karlie Kloss</strong>, who had dominated Dior ready-to-wear campaigns since 2010. In her place are <strong>newbie or non well known models</strong> Daria Strokous, Anna Martynova, Diane Conterato, Nicole Pollard and Marie Piovesan. The use of lesser-known faces and global minimalism unhinge and split the fashion Dior addicts opinion, since some of them claim the ad is an&nbsp;<span><strong>absolute disaster</strong> more suitable for brands like "GAP", while other claim<strong> a</strong><span><strong>&nbsp;stroke of genius</strong>.&nbsp;<span>There is one thing for sure: <strong>the campain has already created the buzz</strong>!</span></span></span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[3D Printed Survival Kit For Women, Complete With Botox-Dispensing Face Mask]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>With tongue-firmly-in-cheek</strong><span>&nbsp;Dutch jeweler Ted Noten has created a survival kit for women that features a Botox-dispensing face mask.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Called '7 Necessities'</strong><span>, the survival kit also contains six other items&mdash;such as a gun, a helmet, a chastity belt, a chatelaine (used by women in the 18th and 19th century to hold important household items), a purse and a pair of glasses.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>While most women</strong><span>&nbsp;would disagree and consider a wedding ring or a crystal ball to be on their survival must-have, this diamond and gold encrusted kit is still an interesting take on what it means to be a woman today&mdash;even if it's from a clich&eacute;d male perspective.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Head over</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://organisationinde.m10.mailplus.nl/genericservice/code/servlet/React?wpEncId=acbyFhLtPI&amp;wpMessageId=12623&amp;userId=31000233&amp;command=viewPage&amp;activityId=test&amp;encId=%7bencId%7d">here</a><span>&nbsp;to find out more about the project.</span></p>
<p><span>[via&nbsp;</span><a href="http://organisationinde.m10.mailplus.nl/genericservice/code/servlet/React?wpEncId=acbyFhLtPI&amp;wpMessageId=12623&amp;userId=31000233&amp;command=viewPage&amp;activityId=test&amp;encId=%7bencId%7d">Ted Noten</a><span>, images via&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671420/a-botox-equipped-survival-kit-for-women-on-the-hunt#1">Fast Co Design</a><span>]</span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;''7 Necessities'';</span><br /><br /><span>The survival kit consists of 7 characteristically feminine necessities, including basic attributes such as a purse, a helmet and a pair of sunglasses, but also exceptional attributes like a chastity belt, a mask, a gun and a traditional &lsquo;Chatelaine&rsquo;. Upon closer inspection, they are not what they seem to be at first glance. Highly ingenious systems with secret compartments are used for storing lipsticks or botox, but also to hide nasty weapons.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The objects have been produced by means of &lsquo;rapid prototyping&rsquo;.&nbsp;The decorations are &lsquo;crafted&rsquo; on the computer. Other details, often hidden away in an extending compartment, reveal that Noten has also used traditional materials, including precious gems, silver and gold.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>With his mix of basic necessities with unanticipated weapons, and of cheap materials with precious metals, Noten keeps wrong-footing his audiences. The fact that every little detail has been executed with painstaking craftsmanship further contributes to the confusion.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span lang="EN-GB">With this challenging project Noten once again defies the rules of the jewel world and enters in an area where art and design meet on communal grounds. He asks many questions, for instance about status symbols, about femininity, and about contemporary life. Apart from this he asks about the status and the locus of craftsmanship. Is it the goldsmith, working on all material details of the design, or is it the designer, seated in front of his computer while drawing his images to be 3D printed with a modern device?</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Four years later,&nbsp;<em>7 Necessities</em>&nbsp;builds on Noten&rsquo;s heavily gendered portfolio, offering up absurdist objects that "every woman" needs. The project stems from Noten&rsquo;s self-described "quest to determine what every woman needs in a survival kit, under any imaginable circumstance, in order to &lsquo;be her own man&rsquo; without forfeiting her femininity."</p>
<p>Among the must-haves? A mask that dispenses Botox, molded to look like Nefertiti; a gun that holds a thumb drive, drugs, and a diamond; a chastity belt with an embedded video screen; and a helmet with a built-in radar system for a "woman on the hunt." A purse of wonders holds anti-wrinkle sperm whale oil, a wedding ring, lipstick, and a crystal ball (all women are witches, duh). The objects are 3-D printed in white and inlaid with a crust of diamonds and gold.</p>
<p>What does it mean for a man to tell a woman that "survival" is about looking young and "snaring a man?" Not that much, somehow. The male-driven vision of femininity perpetrated by the fashion world for decades isn&rsquo;t all that different from Noten&rsquo;s satirical vision, although&nbsp;<em>7 Necessities</em>seems to be mocking third-wave feminism more than it mocks the fashion world. But the objects are beautifully designed if you can get past their cringe-inducing similarity to the real world.

    <title><![CDATA[Tactile Gloves Turn Your Hands Into Vibrating Homing Beacons]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Imagine all the time you&rsquo;ve wasted searching for your keys as your rush out the door. Sure there&rsquo;s those beeper things you can attach to them to find it with your phone, as long as you know where your phone that is. But a new advances in&nbsp;</span><a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2380173" target="_blank">vibrotactile technology</a><span>&nbsp;may help give us clues to finding our lost items faster. Designers from the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://sci.aalto.fi/en/" target="_blank">Helsinki Institute of Information Technology Aalto University</a><span>, the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/university/" target="_blank">University of Helsinki</a><span>, and the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Informatics</a><span>&nbsp;have created&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/vibrating-glove-teaches-the-piano-helps-people-with-spinal-cord-injuries/" target="_blank">vibrating gloves</a><span>&nbsp;that work in conjunction with a Kinect to locate objects. Sorta like playing Hot &amp; Cold, the gloves nudge helps you get closer to what you&rsquo;re looking for.</span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/news/archive/10-2012/11-16-00-51.html" target="_blank">designers in Helsinki</a>&nbsp;have been researching how vibrotactile technology can aid people in the search of items. The gloves have small vibrators on the back that work in conjunction with a motion sensing Kinect system. For their study, the designers asked a group of people to find a &lsquo;B&rsquo; in a field of &lsquo;P&rsquo;s&rsquo; on a canvas. Some people were wearing the gloves and others were not. At first, everyone was able to locate the &lsquo;B&rsquo; right away, but as the trials progressed, more &lsquo;P&rsquo;s&rsquo; were added and it became more difficult to locate the desired letter. Those who were wearing the gloves received vibrations which nudged them in the direction to look. Results showed that those who wore the gloves found the &lsquo;B&rsquo; much faster than those who were using eyesight alone.</p>
<p>The main researcher, Ville Lehtinen of HIIT,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/news/archive/10-2012/11-16-00-51.html" target="_blank">explains</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;the advantage of steering a hand with tactile cues is that the user can easily interpret them in relation to the current field of view where the visual search is operating. This provides a very intuitive experience, like the hand being &lsquo;pulled&rsquo; toward the target.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While maybe the system isn&rsquo;t the most ideal for finding your keys inside your messy house, the technology could reasonably be used for other applications. Say you&rsquo;re in a huge warehouse, library or grocery store looking for one item &ndash; a system like this could be used to locate the item much faster. Rather than wandering around isles searching for it, you tell a computer what you&rsquo;re looking for and the gloves nudge you in the right direction, essentially telling you when you&rsquo;re getting &ldquo;hot&rdquo;.</p>
<h2><strong>When your eyes have trouble spotting an object, the latest in vibrotactile gear could speed up your search.</strong></h2>
<p>My keys seem to disappear just when I&rsquo;m ready to leave the house. What follows is a 10-minute hunt, through closets and under cushions and into the laundry basket (did I leave them in the pocket of the pants I wore last?), until I finally find them in a corner of my messy desk.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably been in such a situation, spending minutes looking around for a book, or your phone, when all the while it was right there, under your nose. You just didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>see</em>&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>A version of the Kinect system, altered in Helsinki, Finland, is being designed to solve this daily visual search problem. It uses fabric, four small motors, and the all-seeing power of the Kinect to guide its wearer toward objects using pulsed nudges.</p>
<p>Designers from the Helsinki Institute of Information Technology Aalto University, the University of Helsinki, and the Max Planck Institute for Informatics are responsible for the innovation. As they&nbsp;<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2380173" target="_blank">explain it</a>, you hold your gloved hand in front of you, and the Kinect senses how close or far away you are from the object you&rsquo;re looking for. It then vibrates to guide you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Twelve volunteers participated in tests to check just how useful such a nudge was in augmenting visual search. Their task was to pick out and point to a letter B projected on a canvas taped to a wall. The catch was, the B was surrounded by a matrix of Ps, making it harder to spot. With each successive testing round, the number of Ps increased.</p>
<p>The authors found that in the early stages, all volunteers aimed their fingers at the B at about the same time. As the scene in front of them became more complex, however, the gloved volunteers receiving touch signals started relying on tactile cues more. After a certain point, they were racing their co-testers, picking out the B on the wall faster than the volunteers who were just using their eyes.</p>
<p>The designers anticipate that a version of their glove could lead you to a particular book in a library&rsquo;s vast stacks, or help spot your favorite cereal box in the breakfast aisle of the grocery store.</p>
<p>The gloves join a rich list of under-construction vibrotactile guides. In development elsewhere are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/418169/vr-and-haptics-for-rehabilitation/">haptic styluses that help stroke victims with rehabilitation,</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/427299/att-reinvents-the-steering-wheel/">steering wheels that give you tactile reminders</a>&nbsp;that you may be veering too far out of your lane, and even bodysuits&nbsp;<a href="http://scopeweb.mit.edu/?p=547" target="_blank">that teach you to dance</a>.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[A New Battery Could Revolutionize Wearables Tech]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>A scalable, print-based, ultrathin, flexible, rechargeable battery with high energy density</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.imprintenergy.com/">Imprint Energy</a> a young startup created in 2012 and specialized in batteries, has designed <strong>a new type of battery</strong>. This new battery uses <strong>zinc instead of lithium</strong>, and screen printing technology. The researches result, led at the University of California &ndash;Berkeley, is an <strong>ultra-thin, scalable, high energy density, flexible, and low cost rechargeable</strong> batteries. The new Californian electrochemistry system also utilizes non-toxic, non-volatile. This innovation is<strong> a gigantic technologic step</strong> and could make possible new types of wearable electronics.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/8366446724_ec145b6f18.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>This battery could ultimately completely change the wearable&nbsp;industry</strong></h2>
<p>The young company aim to<strong> improve portable power</strong> by dramatically reducing its cost and by erasing form factor limitations and security concerns. Imagine how gadget makers should be crazy if they could create gizmos free of any constraints regarding the <strong>challenging battery issue</strong>. This is especially true while designing wearable devices.. and <strong>can even hold a charge if a hole is punched through it</strong>. We don&rsquo;t know though if it could handle seam integration or a full cycle in a washer&hellip; Yet, the news is very exciting for the wearable industry!</p>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[Interactive Hedgehog Dress]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Spikes stand and rise up against potential foe</strong></h2>
<p><span>This conceptual interactive dress, called <strong>the "Hedgehog Dress"</strong> has been&nbsp;created by artist <strong>Yougsil Lee</strong>. The dresse's concept is inspired by the hedgehog or pocupine natural <strong>protection system</strong>. In its normal state, the ornemantal spikes on the garment shoulders are relaxed, and the dress <span>lights up</span>&nbsp;with gentle white LEDs.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8470/8388351878_4352c07e47_b.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p><span>Under any menace detected by captors (such as someone approaching the garment quickly), the spikes stand and rise up against potential foe as <strong>LEDs will turn to a menacing red color</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Connecting Long Distance Valentines - Pillow Talk]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>A new way to feel intimately connected to your significant other when you are far away</strong></h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p><strong>"Pillow Talk"</strong> is a very romantic project developed as thesis project in 2010 by <strong><a href="http://www.joannamontgomery.com/" target="_blank">Joanna Montgomery</a></strong>, a &nbsp;young Scottish designer. The purpose of her project is to&nbsp;<strong>connect long distance lovers</strong>. The result is an intimate <strong>interaction between two lovers, regardless of the distance between them</strong>. Montgomery explains : &ldquo;Each person has a pillow for their bed and a ring sensor which they wear to sleep at night. The sensor wirelessly communicates with the other person&rsquo;s pillow; when one person goes to bed, their lover&rsquo;s pillow begins to glow softly to indicate their presence. Placing your head on the pillow allows you to hear the <strong>real-time heartbeat</strong> of your loved one.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong><span>Take Pillow Talk from prototyping to production</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Pillow Talk</strong> won several awards for innovation. Due to the project popularity, Joanna Montgomery&nbsp;started her own company,&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.littleriot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Little Riot</a></strong>, to develop the product.

    <title><![CDATA[Spray-on Fabric]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Instant, sprayable, non-woven fabric</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>In collaboration with the&nbsp;<strong>Imperial College London's Department of Chemical Engineering</strong>, a&nbsp;British company named <strong><a href="http://www.fabricanltd.com/technology.php" target="_blank">Fabrican</a></strong>&nbsp;has develloped an instant, sprayable, non-woven fabric. Dr&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/manel.torres">Manel Torres</a></strong>, a Spanish fashion designer and <span>an Academic Visitor at Imperial,&nbsp;</span>worked with Paul Luckham, a professor of particle technology&nbsp;at <strong><a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a></strong> to create the material and found the&nbsp;way to liquefy and bond fibers so that non-woven fabric that can be easily sprayed on to any surface like a body or a dress form.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8071/8403487621_8b96f79c6f_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">The building process uses aerosol cans or spray-guns</strong></span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;spray-on fabric is formed by the cross-linking of tiny <strong>fibres combined with polymers</strong> and dissolved in solvent that delivers the <strong>fabric in its liquid form</strong>. To create the fabric,&nbsp;aerosol cans or spray-guns are used.&nbsp;When the sprayed liquid touches the surface and dries, the fibers adhere to one another as the&nbsp;solvent evaporates. The process creates<strong> a thin layer of fabric that can be peeled off</strong>. The result is an instant snug-fitting garment that can be molded or tailored to meet the needs of the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8054/8403487673_50cdc848cf.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The technology has been developed for any use from fashion to healthcare&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
<p>Just like existing fabric <strong>the material can be washed an re-wor</strong>n but it can also be quickly transformed into a new clothing item if the fibers are dissolved into the same solvent and re-sprayed again and again.&nbsp;Not just for clothes, <strong>the technology has household, industrial, personal and health care applications.</strong> "As a non-woven material, Spray-on Fabric offers possibilities for binding, lining, repairing, layering, covering and moulding in ways previously not imaginable..."&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8080/8403449129_98ce9d2673_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Moisturizing Jeans Keep Your Legs Soft]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Spa jeans are in the air</strong></h2>
<p>The brand <strong>Wrangler</strong> has introduced a&nbsp;<strong>"Denim Spa" line</strong>&nbsp;of skinny jeans,&nbsp;that claim to moisturize and even fight cellulite.&nbsp;Last year,<strong><a href="http://www.mohicano.cl/"> Mohicano</a></strong>, a chilean brand, launch a similar pair of jeans called "denim therapy" with the aim to fight cellulite. The Wrangler<strong>&nbsp;"cosmetotextiles"</strong> jeans come in three finishes: Aloe Vera, Olive Extract and Smooth Legs, which aims to prevent cellulite. Hydrating and soothing ingredients used include rose hip oil, retinol, caffeine,&nbsp;apricot kernel oil monoi de Tahiti and shea butter. They are infused onto the jeans fabric, before being dried in an oven.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8493/8412168799_39ddbde1a9_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>
<p>Since the skinny jeans are cut tight, the <strong>close contact between fabric and skin bursts open the microcapsules containing the active extracts</strong>.&nbsp;The effects of the ingredients should last up to two weeks and should resist at six to eight washes. After that? <strong>Reload sprays will also be available to buy</strong> to respritzed the jeans (wich is not a bad thing since a pair will come for about&nbsp;$136). Is it work for this price? Well, according to the Telegraph, the Smooth Legs style was&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/columns/olivia-bergin/TMG9805508/Lizzie-Jagger-models-Wranglers-anti-cellulite-jeans.html" target="_blank">clinically tested by France's Institut Adriant</a></strong>, by 160 women. 69 percent of them reported the appearance of their thighs had improved after wearing the outfit for four weeks in row... eight hours a day, five days a week! Lotion should still have a bright future!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wrangler denim Spa line hits&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asos.com/" target="_hplink">asos.com</a>&nbsp;starting January 28th.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Hight Voltage by Iris Van Herpen]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Electricity inspired collection&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>For her fourth collection&nbsp;presented in Paris as a guest member of the <strong>Chambre syndicale de la Haute Couture</strong>, Dutch designer&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.irisvanherpen.com/">Iris Van Herpen</a></strong>&nbsp;explores the theme of electricity. Named <strong>Voltage</strong>, this collection seeks to <strong>imitate electricity movement and power</strong>. This ability of light and electricity to change states and matters was reinvented and poetically reproduced in an oneiric way using the most<strong> innovative technologie</strong>s.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8357/8425769992_de71d58333_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>3D Printed Couture</strong></h2>
<p>Iris van Herpen is well known for her use of&nbsp;<strong>3D printing</strong>&nbsp;in her collections, endlessly <strong>pushing back the creativity and technologies limits.</strong> Her flexible 3D printed dresses are, in itself, a revolution,&nbsp;and the fruit of her collaboration with<strong> Neri Oxman</strong> of the MIT Media Lab, <strong>Keren Oxman</strong> and <strong>Prof. Craig Carter</strong> of MIT with Stratasys, and architect <strong>Julia Koerner</strong> with Materialise.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[CST-01: The World’s Thinnest Watch]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>The CST-01 is &lsquo;Time&rsquo; embedded in a band</strong></h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1655017763/cst-01-the-worlds-thinnest-watch?ref=recently_launched" target="_blank">CST-01</a></strong>&nbsp;is a minimalist digital watch made of flexible single piece&nbsp;material that was unveiled at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas. CST is actually the acronym for<strong> Central Standard Timing</strong>, a company founded by <strong>Dave Vondle</strong>, adesigner and electrical engineer, and Jerry O&rsquo;Leary, an industrial designer and mechanical engineer. Laminated quoting, flexible components and powered by micro-energy cell, the CST-01 is weighing <strong>12 grams</strong> (which is less than 5 pennies coin) and <strong>measuring 0.5mm in depth</strong> (less than a credit card). Those features make it&nbsp;<strong>the world&rsquo;s thinnest timepiece ever built.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8045/8434419152_c7b558e94f_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Innovative components assembled in the USA</strong></h2>
<p>The concept of the watch was inspired by&nbsp;ultra thinness, readability, ruggedness, flexibility, and low-power qualities of<strong>&nbsp;E Ink segmented displays</strong>. To make the watch as thin as possible, there is <strong>no knobs or buttons</strong> on the watch itself. Charging or setting the time (12 or 24 hour time format) is done on <strong>a separate included base station</strong>. The watch &nbsp;also features <strong>MEC (Micro-Energy Cell) battery</strong>. The MEC in the CST-01 can be charged up to 10,000 times for an estimated long <strong>life of 15 years</strong>. The watch will <strong>full charge in 10 minutes</strong> and should be able to function for a month between charges.</p>
<p>The production, will start on&nbsp;<strong>Friday February 22nd.</strong>&nbsp;The watches should be assembled in the USA. A watch and its base station are expected to cost $179.</p>

<div class="entry-title-go-to">&nbsp;
<p><small>Fruit of the &ldquo;bastard hogberry&rdquo; plant.</small></p>
<p>Inspiration can strike from the unlikeliest of places. Take the amusingly named bastard hogberry plant, for instance. Indigenous to South America, the fruit of the&nbsp;<em><a href="http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=MANO" target="_blank">Margaritaria nobilis</a></em>&nbsp;evolved its vibrant blue hue to entice birds to gobble it up and facilitate the dispersal of its seeds over a wide geographic area. By identifying and replicating the structural elements responsible for the fruit&rsquo;s color, scientists from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/news-events/press-releases/bioinspired-fibers-change-color-when-stretched" target="_blank">Harvard University</a>&nbsp;and the<a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Exeter</a>&nbsp;managed to invent a new kind of photonic fiber that shifts from red to blue&mdash;and several colors in between&mdash;when subject to pressure.</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Fluidity, flexibility</strong><strong> <strong>and mobility</strong></strong></h2>
<p><span><strong><a href="http://viraseres.com/nama/" target="_blank">Nama Instrument</a></strong> is a textile interface and an<strong> &ldquo;open hardware&rdquo;</strong> with open purpose and usage. This completely flexible interface is made of fabric, single&nbsp;<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLilyPad" target="_blank">Lilypad Arduino</a>, five&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9267" target="_blank">Lilypad Accelerometers</a>, one&nbsp;<a href="http://www.digi.com/products/wireless-wired-embedded-solutions/zigbee-rf-modules/point-multipoint-rfmodules/xbee-series1-module#overview" target="_blank">Xbee Module</a>, and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/339" target="_blank">LiPo battery</a> all sewed together manually with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8549" target="_blank">conductive thread</a>. The fabric gives its<strong> physical particularities</strong> such as:&nbsp;fluidity, and mobility to the interface that can be freely folded, twisted, tightened and manipulated <em>ad libitum</em>to generate real time digital data of its movements. Data is gathered by the accelerometers and wirelessly transmitted to a computer through Arduino and Xbee.&nbsp;</span>The project also includes a customizable software specially designed to receive the data from the interface.</p>

<address>Virtual Reality &ndash; Moritz Waldemeyer for Philip Treacy</address>
<h2><strong>The amazing effect is done with propeller headpiece</strong></h2>
<p>The concept is <strong>as simple as genius</strong>: a continuous band of light sweeps around the model head with no apparent physical connection to the wearer at all. This amazing effect is done thanks to a well (and carefully) positioned <strong>propeller headpiece</strong>. Since each blade is finished at the end with LED lights, when in full motion the blades themselves disappear and because of the<strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision">persistance of vision</a></strong>, it creates an ethereal hat of light.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Titanium Utility Ring]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>One of the most unusual rings&nbsp;designed for men</strong></h2>
<p><span><span>Following the&nbsp;</span></span>Swiss&nbsp;Army&nbsp;knife idea, <strong>hidden inside is an assortment of</strong> <strong>five different tools</strong>. Specially designed for men it features a working bottle opener, two blades (one straight great for cutting packing tape or fishing line, and another one, serrated for tougher things like nylon strapping or those tough plastic sealed packages), a <strong>super effective</strong> mini saw for cutting plastic and wood, and a tiny comb that does a surprisingly good job on mustache or head!</p>
<p><span><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8511/8465757631_17a9632355_z.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">Crafted&nbsp;from&nbsp;aerospace grade titanium&nbsp;in the finest jewelery tradition</strong></p>
<p>The rings are&nbsp;<strong>made to measure and&nbsp;handbuilt</strong>. They are crafted&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>aerospace grade titanium&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;brass rivets, one at a time,&nbsp;in the finest jewellery tradition. <strong>Bruce Boone</strong>, the artisan make them in quarter size increments for an exact fit, normally within a thousandth of an inch. The width remains at 9mm. The ring can be engraved for personalization even if the internal construction lines will affect the letters a bit. &nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Nothing Fancy –  Minimal Accessories Line by Chieh Ting Huang]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Non-stitched minimalist line of &ldquo;everyday accessories&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Taiwanese and London-based designer <span><a href="http://cargocollective.com/chieh" target="_blank"><strong>Chieh Ting Huang</strong></a><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>conceived&nbsp;<strong>Nothing Fancy</strong>, a non-stitched minimalist line of &ldquo;everyday accessories&rdquo;. The idea was to create utilitarian objects with the minimal amount of materials, simplifying them to their basic functions. Requiring no stitching, each piece of the line is created from a single piece of leather &ldquo;origami&rdquo; folded and a custom elastic band.&nbsp; No clasps, snaps or any other fittings so the use of minimal material also reduces the accessories thickness.</span></p>
<p><span>Still in the prototype phase, the line offers an iPhone holder, a passport holder, a wallet and a coin purse.&nbsp;</span>You can<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://cargocollective.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b0382a8b75d7c66b4e61cc676&amp;id=e547c772ba" target="_blank"><strong>sign up</strong></a><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;to get notified once the line will be available for sale.</span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Machina’s MIDI Controller Jacket Lets You Create Music With Your Body]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Translate your body movements into music</strong></h2>
<p>Designed for musicians and fans of&nbsp;technology the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.machina.cc/">Machina</a></strong>&nbsp;<strong>Midi&nbsp;Controller&nbsp;Jacket</strong> can translate your body movements into actual music. Called <strong><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/machina/midi-controller-jacket-v01">Machina&rsquo;s &ldquo;MJ v1.0,&rdquo;</a></strong> the jacket insn&rsquo;t just a fancy and nice waterproof outerwear, but <strong>a sophisticated wearable technology</strong> <strong>piece</strong>.&nbsp;The jacket is for now actually so complex that it be only be <strong>made by hand by a master tailor.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8526/8536472981_07fcd77fc1_b.jpg" alt="" /></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Not just an outerwear, it&rsquo;s also a sophisticated piece of equipment</strong></h2>
<p>The jacket combines a <strong>Musical Instrument Digital Interface</strong> (MIDI) and comes with <strong>four flexible motion sensors</strong> that can detect fingers position and operate multiple digital music instruments, computers, and other devices simultaneously. It also features an&nbsp;<strong>accelerometer</strong>&nbsp;that can detect arm&rsquo;s acceleration, <strong>a joystick and four push buttons</strong>. &ldquo;The sensors are invisible except for placeholders,&rdquo; says Machina. &ldquo;We want integration to be complete, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re working so hard in making sure that, while the sensors are there, they do not affect the look and feel of the jacket. The jacket looks like a regular jacket, and it can be worn under any condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8511/8537581212_7dcab29080_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Designed to be hackable</strong></h2>
<p>The jacket is also <strong>a platform that can be programmed</strong> for additional functionalities. The Mexico-based technology firm plans to release a <strong>mobile application for iOS and Android</strong> so users can interact with the MJ v1.0 in a simple way. All of the company&rsquo;s code will be <strong>completely open-sourced</strong>. Besides, Machina&nbsp;is working on a <strong>&ldquo;hackstore&rdquo;</strong> with libraries that will allow users to upload their own presets and to customize the product very easily. Ultimately, the jacket will allow its owner do whatever he want, from engineering beats, mixing video, or even&nbsp;playing videogames. Do you think this kind of garment could be the future of making music?</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Rubin Singer - The Russian Designer who Dressed Beyoncé]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>From Russia to US Super Bowl</strong></h2>
<p>Russian designer<strong> <a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/rubin-singer-spring-2013-collection" target="_blank">Rubin Singer</a></strong> comes from a family of couturiers. His father created costumes for the <strong>Bolshoi Ballet and Stanislavski Theater</strong>. His grandfather, for whom he is named, was one of the most celebrated designers in the Soviet Union, dressing Russian royalty, Soviet political figures, and the social elite. He moved to<strong> New York</strong>, and after beeing among others, an Associate Designer at <strong>Oscar de la Renta</strong>, he launched "The Rubin Singer brand" in 2007, on the principles of <strong>edgy and sophisticated design</strong>. On February 3, during&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/47">Super Bowl</a></strong>&nbsp;halftime show,&nbsp;Beyonce, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, and 120 backup dancers wore his creations.</p>
<h2><strong><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8380/8491086270_e19df7d217_z.jpg" alt="" /></strong></h2>
<p><em>Rubin Singer</em></p>
<h2><strong>Nodic mythology inspiration</strong></h2>
<p>According to a press release, just after Thanksgiving, <strong>Singer presented storyboards from his fall 2013 collection titled &ldquo;Valkyrie&rsquo;s Dominion&rdquo; to Beyonc&eacute;&rsquo;s stylists</strong> Raquel Smith and Ty Hunter. Singer explains :&ldquo;In Nodic mythology a Valkyrie is a female figure who decides which soldiers die in battle and which live. A woman with power, focus and unbridled sexuality; not unlike Ms. Knowles herself, was the starting point". After he was chosen to dress the popstar, <strong>it took over 200 man hours for Singer and his team to build the Super Ball halftime show collection</strong>. Everything (like the bodysuit made of python, iguana, leather and lace wore by Beyonc&eacute;) was <strong>entirely assembled by hand</strong>. &ldquo;We had to make the body suit have a tremendous range of motion and flexibility,&rdquo; Singer said. &ldquo;Beyonc&eacute; is such a fierce and intense performer we could not have the outfit constrict her in any way.&rdquo;</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Russians are back in the hype</strong></h2>
<p>Fashion week season is ending. In each main fashion capital, <strong>designers from all over the world</strong> &ndash; well known and those not so much &ndash; have presented their collections to A-listers, top buyers and magazine editors.&nbsp;<strong>Russians here, are no exception.</strong>&nbsp;New emerging russian designers are ready to conquer the fashion scene and it seems like it&rsquo;s the perfect time for them to show what they&rsquo;re able to do since the interest in <em>everything Russian</em> seems to be hype again.</p>

<h2><strong>A collection inspired by artist&nbsp;<strong>John Everett Millais &amp; W.</strong>Shakespeare</strong></h2>
<p>The New York based designer <strong><a href="http://www.rubinsinger.com/collections/home/">Rubin Singer</a></strong>, who is&nbsp;a <strong>third-generation couturier of Russian descent</strong>, launched his label in the city in 2007. Since then, his popularity never stop to expend and we think we will hear a lot about him in the near future.

<p>"Described as the most poetic death scenes in literature, this beautiful and haunting painting's depth and complexity inspired me profoundly" Singer explained.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[High-Tech Bodysuit Gives Visually Impaired “Spider Sense”]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>A project freely inspired by Marvel Superhero Spiderman</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.vmateevitsi.com/">Victor Mateevitsi</a></strong>&nbsp;a computer-science graduate student at the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.uic.edu/uic/">University of Illinois in Chicago</a></strong>&nbsp;built a high-tech bodysuit named <strong>&rdquo;SpiderSense&rdquo;</strong>. If Mateevitsi's suit idoesn&rsquo;t spray any web fluid from its wrists, it however,&nbsp;could give the visually impaired real-life &ldquo;Spidey sense&rdquo; that allows real spiders to detect potential threats or impediments. Exactly like the <strong>Marvel Comics superhero&nbsp;<a href="http://marvel.com/comics/characters/1009610/spider-man">Spider-Man</a></strong>, this&nbsp;suit lets the wearer feel how close he is to a nearby object. It can even let him navigate with his eyes closed.</p>

<h2><strong>Small robotic arms,&nbsp;microphone-equipped modules and&nbsp;ultrasounds...</strong></h2>
<p>The project is <strong>freely inspired by&nbsp;Peter Parker</strong>,&nbsp;the comic-book character. His superpowers allow him to "feel a tingly sensation"&nbsp;to warn to an imminent threat. <strong>About technology</strong>, the &rdquo;SpiderSense&rdquo; bodysuit features small robotic arms encased in seven microphone-equipped modules that send and receive <strong>ultrasonic reflections</strong> from close objects. Distributed across the suit, <strong>the modules</strong> <strong>give the wearer as near to 360 degree ultrasound coverage as possible</strong> and when the ultrasound detects someone (or something) moving closer, the arms respond by&nbsp;exerting a growing pressure on the part of the body&nbsp;closest to the danger. &ldquo;When someone is punching Spider-Man, he feels the sensation and can avoid it&rdquo;&nbsp;Mateevitsi&nbsp;says. &ldquo;Our suit is the same concept.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mateevitsi&nbsp;and his team&nbsp;now plans to add more sensors to the suit to increase its resolution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>A technology that could be used to increase security, for cyclists as an example</strong></h2>
<p>Mateevitsi wants now to <strong>use his sensors technology in the real life</strong>, to increase cyclists' awareness of other traffic on the road for example.</p>
<p>Mateevitsi's study&nbsp;&ldquo;Sensing the Environment through SpiderSense&rdquo; has been accepted at the 4th&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hcilab.org/ah2013">Augmented Human&nbsp;International Conference</a>&nbsp;in Stuttgart, Germany and will be presenting on Thursday March 7th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recent scientific advances allow the use of technology to expand the number of forms of energy that can be perceived by humans. Smart sensors can detect hazards that human sensors are unable to perceive, for example radiation. This fusing of technology to human&rsquo;s forms of perception enables exciting new ways of perceiving the world around us. In this paper we describe the design of SpiderSense, a wearable device that projects the wearer&rsquo;s near environment on the skin and allows for directional awareness of objects around him. The millions of sensory receptors that cover the skin presents opportunities for conveying alerts and messages. We discuss the challenges and considerations of designing similar wearable devices&rdquo;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[3Doodler: The World's First 3D Printing Pen]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2 id="title"><strong>A pen that can draw 3D plastic objects</strong></h2>
<p>3Doodler&nbsp;by U.S. toy and robotics company&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wobbleworks.net/" target="_blank">WobbleWorks</a>,&nbsp;is <strong>a</strong> <strong>3D printing pen you can hold in your hand</strong>. Compact and easy to use, the pen requires no software or computers. Actually, its technology seems very simple as it works like a hot glue gun. It just needs to be plug into a power socket and the user can start drawing anything within minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1351910088/3doodler-the-worlds-first-3d-printing-pen/widget/video.html" frameborder="0" width="600" height="450"></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>See your drawing become a real three dimensional object</strong></h2>
<p>As the user draws <strong>in the air or on surfaces</strong> (a stencil for example), the pen extrudes <strong>heated ABS plastic</strong> (the material used by many 3D printers).&nbsp;The ABS plastic filament extruded in a fine line cools&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;and solidifies into a<strong> stable structure</strong>. This technology allows anyone to build an infinite variety of shapes and items really easily.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong><br /></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>3Doodler is the world&rsquo;s first and only 3D Printing Pen.</strong></h2>
<p>3Doodler&nbsp;is described on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1351910088/3doodler-the-worlds-first-3d-printing-pen?ref=live" target="_blank">the crowdfunding WobbleWorks website</a>&nbsp;as the world's first 3D printing pen. It coust should be around $75 (US$).</p>
<p><strong>Components &amp; Accessories:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The pen:</strong>&nbsp;The 3Doodler pen is 180mm by 24mm. The pen weighs less than 200 grams or 7 ounces (the weight of a typical apple), although the exact weight will depend on the final shell specifications once in production. The pen will work on 110v or 240v.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Ink (i.e. ABS/PLA plastic):&nbsp;</strong>The 3Doodler uses 3mm ABS or PLA plastic as its "ink" - just like a 3D printer. Note that a 1 ft ABS strand produces approximately 11 ft of 3Doodling extruded filament.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Nike uses 3D printing for new football shoes ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Nike has unveiled the first boots for American football players with 3D-printed stud</strong></h2>
<p><span>Nike is now using 3D printing technology to develop its new American football boot, in what it claims is an industry first.</span></p>
<p>Using a selective laser sintering (SLS) technique, the company will include a 3D printed plate as part of the sole of its new Vapor Laser Talon product.</p>
<p>SLS is a manufacturing technique involving the use of high-powered lasers to fuse small particles of materials into a 3-dimensional shape.</p>
<p>The SLS lasers are focused onto a bed of powder and at each spot the laser is pointed it &lsquo;sinters&rsquo;, or melts, the powder into a solid, a few microns at a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SLS technology has revolutionized the way we design cleat plates &ndash; even beyond football &ndash; and gives us the capability to create solutions that were not possible within the constraints of traditional manufacturing processes,&rdquo; said Nike&rsquo;s footwear innovation director, Shane Kohatsu.</p>
<p>Nike says that the new 3D plate is a result of &ldquo;proprietary material selection&rdquo; which has enabled the company to &ldquo;prototype a fully functional plate and traction system within a fraction of the traditional timeframe and at a fraction of the weight&rdquo; &ndash; enabling a supply chain based on a &lsquo;make to order&rsquo; model, as opposed to &lsquo;make to stock&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SLS process allows for the engineering and creation of shapes not possible in traditional manufacturing processes. It also provides the ability to make design updates within hours instead of months to truly accelerate the innovation process to never seen speeds,&rdquo; it said in a statement announcing the development.</p>
<p>To ensure its athletes have the best chance of showcasing their full speed potential, Nike Football presents the new Nike Vapor Laser Talon, specifically designed for superlative speed during the NFL Combine&rsquo;s most famous 4-plus seconds. The shoe utilizes the innovative new 3D printed plate, constructed using Selective Laser Sintering technology (SLS) to create a cleat plate and traction system at a fraction of the usual weight.</p>
<p>According to legendary speedster (and Olympic gold medalist) Michael Johnson, who helps prospects train for the 40, &ldquo;Nike&rsquo;s new 3D printed plate is contoured to allow football athletes to maintain their drive position longer and more efficiently, helping them accelerate faster through the critical first 10 yards of the 40.&rdquo; Johnson continues, &ldquo;Translated to the game of football, mastering the Zero Step can mean the difference between a defensive lineman sacking the quarterback or getting blocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Nike's Vapor Laser Talon use of 3D printing is a revolutionary step for sustainable design</span></p>]]></body>

    <title><![CDATA[10-Year Hoodie]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h1 class="subtitle">The 10-Year Hoodie by Flint and Tinder is Designed to Last a Lifetime</h1>
<p><span>designed in a slim, modern fit</span></p>
<div class="separator">Not many garments boast a 10 year guarantee that pledges to mend unlikely rips, tears or other damages free or charge. Then again, few are made from from scratch in America with this level of care. Flint and Tinder's 10-Year Hoodie combines a tight, 18oz 100% cotton all-weather knit with 3-end yarn fleece lining, reinforced mock safety stitch seams (one unravelling thread won't ruin these seams), a twill tape-reinforced industrial zipper, and heavy weight Lycra cuffs. The result is a nigh-indestructible hoodie that's poised to become your go-to sweatshirt, and that should endure a lifetime of abuse - otherwise, Flint and Tinder will gladly repair it, free of charge, through 2023.</div>
<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="separator">Hit up&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jakehimself/the-10-year-hoodie-built-for-life-backed-for-a-dec">Kickstarter</a>&nbsp;for details - $90</div>
<p><span>Hoodies are often that go-to clothing choice when it comes to relaxing at home, but they often lack longevity or durability; the 10-Year Hoodie however, is specially designed to offer individuals a long-lasting product that provides function and style.</span><br /><br /><span>While most pieces of casual clothing are easily ripped or ruined, the 10-Year Hoodie is extremely durable and weather-resistant, allowing it to last for years on end. Created by Flint and Tinder, this unique sweater is customized and made in the United States, and utilizes high-quality materials and sewing techniques to create a strong and visually appealing piece of clothing.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The creators of this hoodie are so confident about the product's endurance that they even offer a 10-year warranty to those who buy this sweater. So, if you're looking to invest in something that will last you a lifetime, then this well-made hoodie is a great choice</span></p>
<h1><strong>THE STORY:</strong></h1>
<p>It starts when the Flint and Tinder team overheard a conversation in a factory we were visiting. Someone was talking about using coarse thread with delicate fabric. Doing this accelerates the process of wearing holes into a garment as it goes through the dryer time and time again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a common trick of the trade. It's one of several techniques companies secretly use to ensure that if you like what you've bought, you'll be forced to replace it soon.</p>
<p>In the manufacturing industry, this is known as "planned obsolescence."</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way though &mdash; far from it. Eager to prove a point, send a message, and make a sweatshirt that could last a lifetime (the way your favorite sweatshirt should), we set out to make a premium piece that's so well constructed customers would rather have it mended (free of charge, of course) than replaced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'd like to think we've done just that. It's more than a sweatshirt though; it's a battle cry. Not everything should be disposable. It's time to buy less, but get more!</p>

    <title><![CDATA[The World's First Fully Articulated 3D Printed Gown]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2 class="entry-title"><strong>Dita Von Teese Models Intricate 3D-Printed Gown</strong></h2>
<p>Earlier this week, at the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://acehotel.com/newyork">Ace Hotel</a></strong>&nbsp;in New York City, the <strong>world's 1st fully articulated "3D Printed Gown"</strong> was revealed.&nbsp;The dress was designed (on an iPad!) by designer&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.michaelschmidtstudios.com/">Michael Schmidt</a></strong>&nbsp;&amp; architect&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://francisbitonti.com/">Francis Bitonti</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;3D printed in&nbsp;<span>hardened powdered</span> Nylon by <strong><a href="http://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/1952-Revealing-Dita-Von-Teese-in-a-Fully-Articulated-3D-Printed-Gown.html" target="_blank">Shapeways</a></strong>&nbsp;for burlesque icon&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.dita.net/">Dita Von Teese</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8094/8553792479_4dc720efd4_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>The "3D dress" used 17 different types of pieces connected by&nbsp;3,000 little joints</strong></h2>
<p>All the <strong>made to measure&nbsp;components</strong> were 3D printed to fit Dita von Teese's body. The <strong><a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html" target="_blank">Fibonacci&nbsp;sequence</a></strong>&nbsp;inspired mesh components, created in collaboration with <strong>Shapeways,</strong> consists of <strong>thousands of individual nylon components.&nbsp;</strong>Dyed black,&nbsp;lacquered&nbsp;and adorned with more than 13,000 Swarovski crystals, the fully articulated gown&nbsp;was assembled from 17 pieces made of this mesh.&nbsp;<span>The hollow components of the dress allow it to remain light weight at 11.5 lbs.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8377/8554897822_506ac36536_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Something you would want to see more of?</strong></h2>
<p>The inspiration and technology behind this articulated 3D printed gown is in the mood of the time. <strong>The material properties used for 3D printing already changed and will develop</strong> to produce more fine, flexible textures we will see more and more on the catwalks. 3D printing makes its debut in haute couture and art but as we have seen with <strong><a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/hight-voltage" target="_blank">Iris von Herpen</a></strong> or Nike,&nbsp;we will see more and more 3D printing elements into the world of clothing and fashion until it becomes ubiquitous.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Google Could Work With Warby Parker to Make “GoogleGlass” more fashionable ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>The giant Google teams with startup eyeglass company&nbsp;Warby Parker</strong></h2>
<p>According to&nbsp;anonymous sources who spoke with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/technology/google-looks-to-make-its-computer-glasses-stylish.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em></a>&nbsp;last Thursday,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/tag/google" target="_blank">Google</a>&nbsp;is working on a partnership with&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/warby-parker-suno-collaborate-on-limited-edition-sunglasses-for-a-cause/" target="_blank">Warby Parker</a>,&nbsp;a two years old hipster&nbsp;eyeglass company</strong> well known for its fancy and fairly priced goods as well as for its nice<strong> &ldquo;buy a pair, give a pair&rdquo;</strong> business model (for every pair of frames purchased, the company provides another one to someone in need). The New York based Warby Parker company is often <strong>considered as a tech startup</strong> because, although it has showrooms around the USA, it only conducts sales online and offers a clever system that allows customers to <strong>virtually try on glasses</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8553909457_ca6d2131cd_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>More-fashionable frames</strong></h2>
<p>The aim of this collaboration between the giant Google and the small eyeglass startup is to design &ldquo;more-fashionable frames&rdquo; for the not yet on sale but already superfamous&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/google-s-project-glass" target="_blank">&ldquo;Google Glass&rdquo; headset</a></strong>&nbsp;in order&nbsp;to<strong>&nbsp;reinforce its&nbsp;accessory positioning</strong>. Unveiled earlier last year, the Google headset made was introduced to the fashionistas during the 2012 September&nbsp;New York Fashion Week&nbsp;when models wore colored versions at&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.3ds.com/fashionlab/en/mag/article/a-model-s-eye-view-of-new-york-fashion-week-via-google-glass" target="_blank">Diane von Furstenberg&rsquo;s runway show.</a></strong></p>

<p>Fashion &amp; Technology LAB aims at creating emulation between creativity and innovation in the fashion industry.</p>
<div class="read-more">We encourage interactions between fashion and technology to bring out profitable businesses (designers and fashion start-ups). The adoption of new technologies by the creative businesses is a source of differentiation and a competitive advantage. New technological tools, across the processes, may expand their growth potential. On the other hand, fashion is a significant driver of innovation, as evidenced by the many start-ups deploying new concepts throughout the value chain of fashion.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>F&amp;T Lab develops gateways to share knowledge, skills and vision, and pool resources.<br />As a catalyst, we mobilise the talents and energies, and integrate the financial community throughout the development process of the companies who join us.</p>
<p><span>We rely on a network of experts and mentors familiar with the environment and issues specific to young fashion companies and the global fashion and luxury industries.</span></p>

    <title><![CDATA[Picture of Full Figured H&M Mannequins Provoke Controversy Over 'Obese Americans']]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2 class="top-block-title"><strong>Picture of curvy mannequins poted on Facebook generates a tremendous response from social media users</strong></h2>
<p><strong>H&amp;M</strong>&nbsp;<strong>has sparked a social media storm</strong> after&nbsp;showcasing full-figured mannequins in Sweden retail stores. Since a blogger for&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/WOMENSRIGHTSNEWS/photos_stream" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Women's Rights News"</a></strong>&nbsp;posted the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=510240455685022&amp;set=a.204542062921531.45848.184599864915751&amp;type=1&amp;theater">photo</a></strong>&nbsp;of those curvy mannequins&nbsp;on Facebook, the shot gone viral and stired contoversy. The picture had more than 54,000 likes and 17,000 shares this Friday.<strong> Comments both criticize and praise the unusual curvy figures</strong> draped in skimpy lingerie but most of the commenters applaud the snapshot and H&amp;M initiative for reflecting real female body types.</p>
<h2><strong>Beautiful women come in all sizes</strong></h2>
<p>At the end of 2012, a&nbsp;<a href="http://reddit.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a>&nbsp;user posted a picture of a mannequin that reflected real-life average american proportions. As a gag, he referred to it as an &ldquo;obese mannequin.&rdquo;&nbsp;Retail store mannequins have long been criticized for&nbsp;<strong>not reflecting the real average female body</strong>. Typically the average mannequin size in clothing stores is a size 4, when the American women's average size is 14.&nbsp;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Les Ailes Noires - 3D clothes Rails Designed by Studio +tongtong.]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>+TONGTONG Launches the "les ailes Noires" clothing rack collection inspired by line drawings.</strong></h2>
<p>Multidisciplinary Canadian based design studio&nbsp;+tongtong&nbsp;launched a series of clothing racks designed to be super flexible and playful in a variety of environments. The geometric welded steel collection is inspired by line drawings <strong>and how these lines can communicate three dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8108/8641951473_7b21d57a41_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2>3D perspective and trompe-l&rsquo;oeils</h2>
<p>The serie includes 11 pieces that seem two-dimensional when viewed straight on. When placed against a white wall, the two-dimensional projection and gray geometric shadow of the black wireframe are striking and appear drawn, creating the illusion of more volumes, as the&nbsp;perception changes from the 2D to 3D.<strong>&ldquo;I was trying to create something that was more than a hanging rail on wheels or wall system,&rdquo; says&nbsp;+tongtong&nbsp;principal John Tong.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8241/8643050732_99b193a754_c.jpg" alt="" /></strong></p>
<h2>A unique illusion, and, alone, a thing of modern art&nbsp;</h2>
<p><span><span><span><span>The collection by&nbsp;</span><a href="http://tongtong.co/" target="_blank">+tongtong</a><span>&nbsp;contains 11 pieces</span></span></span></span>&nbsp;including a full-length mirror, a wall-mounted sideboard with glass shelf, a ceiling-hung rack and eight freestanding racks designed to sturdy lean against a wall without the need for any hardware. Made of welded 19x19 millimetre steel bars, the pieces are available by special order in flat black, white powder coating or polished chrome versions.</p>

    <title><![CDATA[From Sketch to Creation - Franck Muller Watches  ]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How a 3D CAD software helps one of the world finest watchmaker to innovate</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Watchmaker&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.franckmuller.com/en/home/" target="_blank">Frank Muller</a></strong>&nbsp;(Geneva, Switzerland) is well known to&nbsp;focus exclusively on&nbsp;<strong>mechanical watches&nbsp;with complications</strong>.&nbsp;If the whe watchmaking industry and&nbsp;particularly the fine watchmaking segment&nbsp;is still bound by tradition and consequently&nbsp;not very open to innovation, especially in terms of design, Franck Muller is&nbsp;<strong>thinking differently for the best of the industry</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8383/8610899287_80ae15b08b_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">Innovative spirit, perfect technique and tradition</strong></p>
<p>By&nbsp;pushing the barriers of watchmaking even further with an&nbsp;<strong>innovative spirit and&nbsp;perfect technique</strong>, the Franck Muller&nbsp;engineering team designed the most complex and expensive watches with thousands of tiny moving parts&nbsp;<strong>using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.solidworks.com/" target="_blank">SolidWorks 3D software</a></strong>&nbsp;while&nbsp;fully&nbsp;<strong>respecting the Swiss watchmaking tradition</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8536/8610899257_82bab99c87.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Nicholas Rudaz,&nbsp;Franck Muller Group&nbsp;director of operations explains: &ldquo;Watchmaking is both a science and an art, requiring the contributions of designers and engineers, craftsmen and artisans. We came to realize that continuing along a path of ever-advancing complication&mdash;while maintaining the beautiful aesthetics for which we are known&mdash;would require increasing levels of automation, simulation, and control. In short, we understood that we needed to leverage computer-based development technologies to continue to push the complexity of our designs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this movie, you'll see how the SolidWorks 3D technologies enabled Franck Muller's teams to bring&nbsp;<strong>new innovations to an old world craft.</strong></p>

    <body><![CDATA[<p><strong><span>a Google art project from SXSW 2013 that offers faint praise or biting sarcasm based on your walking habits</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Last year, the company&nbsp;</span><a href="http://adwords.blogspot.com/2012/02/google-discovery-house-at-sxsw.html" target="_blank">created an entire village</a><span>&nbsp;near the Convention Center.

<p><strong><span><span>It's not intended to be a consumer product &mdash; the project comes out of Google's Art, Copy, &amp; Code initiative, whose tagline is "Advertising Re-imagined." With an Arduino board, some key sensors (pedometer, gyroscope, etc.), and a bit of snarky code, the shoe tracks how active you are and will respond accordingly with either faint praise or biting sarcasm.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Google has been showing off a talking shoe at this year&rsquo;s South by Southwest (SXSW) festival</strong>. The shoe monitors the wearer&rsquo;s activity on Google&rsquo;s playground at the event, and either gives encouragement or snarky remarks based on level of movement. Whether that sounds like something you&rsquo;d want to buy or not is irrelevant, because <strong>Google has already said it&rsquo;s not something they&rsquo;re looking to put into production</strong>.</p>
<p>The shoe has a built-in Arduino board connected to a gyroscope, accelerometer, and pedometer. What does it do with this technology? It judges you of course. Lounging around while wearing your Google Talking Shoe? Expect snide comments delivered in the voice of a judgmental British man. If you&rsquo;re really hustling your way around the obstacles at the playground Google has set up for SXSW, you can expect some words of encouragement.</p>
<p>What you can&rsquo;t expect to do is buy a pair. They aren&rsquo;t for sale, and Google says the shoes were not designed as a consumer product. The shoes came out of Google&rsquo;s Art, Copy, &amp; Code initiative which has the slogan &ldquo;Advertising Re-Imagined.&rdquo; Sure, Google could have printed up a bunch of posters or made some videos to show at other events to get attention for their company, but instead they made talking shoes and are giving people a chance to play with them in a heavily branded environment. That&rsquo;s re-imagined advertising if I&rsquo;ve ever seen it.</p>
<p>Despite the snarky British attitude, the technology in the shoe isn&rsquo;t anything groundbreaking. The Arduino board and sensors link back to a computer, or a phone, via Bluetooth and process the information to determine the reply. It basically does what most smartphones are capable of already with fitness tracking apps, just presented in a fun way to get people talking about the cool new thing Google did.</p>
<p>Since the shoes won&rsquo;t be hitting the market any time soon, or probably ever, if you want to get your hands on a pair to try them out, you&rsquo;d better get to the Google Playground at SXSW before it&rsquo;s gone, since we don&rsquo;t know when or if these things will pop up again.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t make it to SXSW, the folks at The Verge managed to get their hands on a pair, and spoke with <strong>Kate Pacher</strong> from Google in this video. Check it out here:</p>

    <title><![CDATA[The Thinnest Premium Leather Customizable RFID Blocking Wallet is Australian]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Stop thieves scanning your credit cards or stealing your identity&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Created by Australian designer <strong><a href="http://www.jameswatson.com.au/whoisjw.html" target="_blank">James Watson</a></strong>,&nbsp;the Bantam Wallet is the thinnest leather customizable&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification"><strong>Radio-frequency identification</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>RFID)</strong></a>&nbsp;blocking wallet. Why an RFID blocking system in a wallet? The safety equipment will <strong>block potential theives scanning your credit cards or stealing your identity</strong>. Here, the protection is customizable since you can just insert a RIFD super-thin protection in your wallet to block the whole wallet, half, or none.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8391/8617024216_5b98894d22_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><strong>Minimalist design, durable, light and perfect for any sized pocket</strong></h2>
<p>At <strong>only 4mm thin (about 5/32inches)&nbsp;and super light</strong>, the wallet fits easily into and out of any pocket. Made in Australia&nbsp;using <strong>super tough ethical, sustainable and government approved&nbsp;Australian kangaroo leather</strong> (thinner than cow leather and far stronger than any other leather in the world)&nbsp;it will keep credit cards safe, and invisible to wandering eyes when it will be open. Also, there is no risk of anything falling out even if you drop it. <strong>Despite of its thinness, it&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>allows for a number of cards and cash to be carried</strong>. Watson claims you CAN stuff a lot of cards, cash, dockets, post-it-notes, even coins and keys!</span></p>
<p><strong>Launched on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;filter_title=wallet&amp;search_submit=Search" target="_blank">indiegogo</a></strong>&nbsp;today (April 3rd), the wallet will be <strong>available for USD$39</strong> (Early Birds supportive price. Changes to AUD$49 after Indiegogo).

    <title><![CDATA[ H&M Conscious Collection]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>H&amp;M &ldquo;ongoing commitment to a more sustainable fashion future"</strong></h2>
<p>On march 25th, retailer H&amp;M launched an &ldquo;eco-conscious&rdquo; collection entirely made from more sustainable materials, such as organic cotton, recycled polyester, and Tencel. Called&nbsp;<strong>Conscious Collection, </strong>it&nbsp;includes <strong>pieces to suit many different styles</strong> like printed trousers, elaborate bombers, easy going tunics and floaty, ruffle-edged yellow sundress, corporate blazers, floral maxi dresses&hellip; <strong>The range is part of the Swedish brand&rsquo;s &ldquo;ongoing commitment to a more sustainable fashion future</strong>". H&amp;M also claims it was <strong>the biggest user of organic cotton in 2011</strong> and is committing to <strong>use only organic cotton and being zero discharge by 2020</strong>, according&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wwd.com/retail-news/mass-off-price/hm-launches-recycling-initiative-6522977" target="_blank"><em>WWD</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A global garment collecting project</h2>
<p>Alongside the new collection, the Swedish brand also launched on March 25th a&nbsp;<strong>clothing exchange initiative</strong>. To encourage customers to <strong>recycle garments</strong>, participating H&amp;M stores will now collect bags of unwanted clothes. In exchange shoppers will be gifted with an H&amp;M voucher (for 15% off on one item of the customer&rsquo;s choice). Donated clothes don&rsquo;t have to be in good condition or carry an H&amp;M label and will be <strong>recycled and potentially used to make new clothing.&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Our sustainability efforts are rooted in a dedication to social and environmental responsibility,&rdquo; H&amp;M CEO Karl-Johan Persson&nbsp;said in a statement. &ldquo;We want to do good for the environment, which is why we are now offering our customers a convenient solution: to be able to leave their worn out or defective garments with H&amp;M.&rdquo;</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Fashion and Technology Exhibition at FIT - New York City]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2>Highlighting the intersection of fashion and technology over the past 250 years</h2>
<p><strong>Fashion and Technology</strong>,&nbsp;an exhibition running through May 8 2013 at the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://bit.ly/OlUBhO" target="_blank">Museum at&nbsp;FIT</a></strong>&nbsp;(New York City) shows the impact of technology over the past 250 years to present day and poses the question as to what technology is while showing how it has changed culture.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8260/8641741710_2da66d212d_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This exhibition shows&nbsp;<strong>how culture was impacted by fashion</strong>, and, most importantly, is the occasion to see<strong>&nbsp;how the fashion industry was impacted with technologies</strong>. The introduction of materials such as petroleum, cellophane, PVC and neoprene&nbsp;helped designers to expand their creativity, while the manufacturing processes where revolutionnized with introduction of new equipments and technologies. The jacquard loom for example, allowed common people to have access to woven textiles (that were originally only available to the wealthy). The&nbsp;<strong>sewing machines, invented i</strong><strong>n 1790 by&nbsp;Thomas Saint,</strong>&nbsp;generalized mass clothes production as it&nbsp;improved the efficiency and productivity of the clothing industry.</p>
<p>The exhibition also&nbsp;<strong>features more recent garments</strong>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<strong>great section of wearable tech</strong>&nbsp;pieces to show just what&rsquo;s to come in the future.</p>
<p>For more information, visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/OlUBhO" target="_blank">The Museum at FIT</a></p>

    <title><![CDATA[The Secret of The Minute-Repeater]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>What is a Minute Repeater?</strong></h2>
<p>A repeater is <strong>a complication in a mechanical watch that chimes the time on demand</strong> by activating a push or a slide-piece. <strong>Each hour, quarter hour and minute has specific tones.</strong> By counting the tones and the different tone pattern, it is possible to determine the current time set on the watch. Minute repeater was<strong> created before the electric lighting invention in the mid-18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Century.</strong>&nbsp;At that time its&nbsp;practical&nbsp;function was to allowed blind people to use a watch, and for everyone else, to be able to&nbsp;<strong>determine the time in the dark</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8391/8675439997_a341340ea6_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Picture: Blancpain</p>
<h2><strong>How it works?</strong></h2>
<p>Different types of repeater allow the time to be determined with varying degrees of precision (from quarter-repeater which just strikes the number of hours and quarters, to the minute repeater that sounds the time down to the minute using separate tones for hours, quarter-hours and minutes). Today <strong>minute repeater is one of the most complex repeater mechanisms</strong>. Here the hours are generally struck in low notes, double strikes of high and low notes indicate the quarters and minutes are sounded in high notes.</p>
<p>Dong Dong Dong, Ding Dong Ding Dong, Ding Ding!</p>
<p>Here you'll have to count the number of hours struck (three), add the the quarters (two = 30mn) and then the minutes (two) to arrive at time of 03:32!</p>

<address>Picture: Blancpain</address>
<h2><strong>Why the minute-repeater such a difficult complication to deal with?</strong></h2>
<p>The main difficulty of this<strong> incredible complication that combines a watch mechanism with a chime</strong> that must fits on a wrist, is not only the<strong> number of the elements</strong>&nbsp;needed to craft it, but also their nature and <strong>super tiny size</strong>. The minute-repeaters are <strong>rare masterpieces of precision</strong> mechanical engineering. There is no coincidence if they are craved by collectors and watch lovers. Incidentally, <strong>over the past year, around twenty new minute repeaters have been launched in the luxury wristwatch market</strong>&nbsp;by brands as diverse in style and heritage as Blancpain, Bulgari, Jaeger LeCoultre, Louis Vuitton, Audemars Piguet, Parmigiani Fleurier, VanCleef &amp; Arpels, Breguet, Patek Philippe, Cartier, Hublot, Ulysse Nardin, Girard-Perregaux or Speake-Marin.&nbsp;</p>

<address><span style="font-size: 10px;">Picture: Blancpain</span></address>
<h2><strong>Each minute-repeater is in its way unique</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;The methods involved to produce such mechanical and acoustic marvels are <strong>incompatible with the common search for productivity. </strong>Moreover,&nbsp;a &nbsp;minute-repeater entirely built by an unique watchmaker is a guarantee of its extreme quality. But if each other single craftsman has his style and his ear, are every minute-repeater unique? Is a creator will recognize his work when it returns for a service? The head of the complications workshops at <strong><a href="http://www.blancpain.com/" target="_blank">Blancpain</a></strong>,<strong> the brand well known for its amazing watch complications</strong>, answers: <em>&ldquo;The watchmaker who assembled {a minute-repeater} will recognize it for sure. Yet on the whole it won&rsquo;t be any different from another. What we emphasize here is a consistent process, methodology and the handing down of knowledge that sets out and explains what you have to do in each operation from the assembly of subcomponents to the final casing up. The basic work has to be identical. Thereafter you will find the watchmaker&rsquo;s personal touch, in a decoration for example or in the various widths of a chamfer.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></body>

<h2><strong>One monolithic piece of material</strong></h2>
<p>The glasses frames, hinges included,&nbsp;are <strong>printed with nylon powder</strong> and using selective laser sintering (SLS) technology. "It has a stem that's flexible one way and stops the other," said Arad.&nbsp;He added: "The brand wanted to advertise the fact that it's printed but I said let's not go on about it. But it's printed. It's <strong>the first pair of glasses that I know about that is one piece of material</strong>; it's monolithic. It's polyamide."</p>

    <title><![CDATA[Ressence Type 3 Watch :  An Unique Way to Display Time]]></title>
    <body><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Purity and minimalism</strong></h2>
<p>With a total of total of 407 components and a weight of 175 grams, the design of the <strong><a href="http://ressence.eu/type3_promo2/" target="_blank">Ressence Type 3 Watch</a></strong> is characterized by its purity and minimalims. But this wristwatch real particularity is its <strong>unique way to display time</strong>: the <strong>constantly orbiting indications discs are bathed in a fluid</strong> that refracts light like air, so that the indications appear to be displayed directly onto the sapphire crystal exterior.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8393/8693456185_6e5f843fd0_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Type 3 Technical Specifications</h2>
<p>This futuristic wristwatch uses <strong>a completely new time of mechanism</strong>. There is no Crown here. Instead, the Type 3 watch features a <strong>gravitational gear system</strong> with information transmitted from movement to indications by micro-magnetic fields, through which it is possible to adjust the time and date. The watch allowed to read the Date, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds (360&rsquo;&rsquo;) and is made of a sandwich construction with <strong>titanium membrane between movement and fluid-filled indication module</strong> and a sapphire crystal and grade 5 titanium case.</p>
